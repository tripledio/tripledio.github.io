# Clean Architecture Immersion course.
In today's world software gets written at an incredible pace. Every day, new software is put in production all over the world. However, as time progresses we realize that maintaining that code becomes harder and harder. Why is that? What makes this software so hard to maintain? 

This course will introduce you to the SOLID principles. These principles acts as a guidance while developing and will help you to right better code. As we progress through these principles we will start noticing that these principles apply at different levels of abstraction. SOLID applied at component level becomes the basis for component design. SOLID applied at an architectural level results into a ports and adapters style of architecture.
