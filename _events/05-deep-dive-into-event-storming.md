# Deep dive into event storming.

Event Storming is a deceptively simple yet powerful technique, originating from the DDD community. It is easy to start with and can be used for different purposes. We offer a deep course in Event Storming so you are confident in applying this technique for a variety of problems.. 

For additional information see our blog post: [Event storming a restaurant](../09/04/2019/event-storming-a-restaurant/).*

## Contents
+ How to facilitate big picture event storming.
+ How to use process modelling to discover processes and aggregates.
+ Domain modelling using event storming.
+ Use event storming for discovering bounded contexts, ubiquitous language and aggregates

**Intended audience**

The deep dive course expects some familiarity with some of the DDD concepts. Though a willingness to learn and actively participate is much more important than pre-existing DDD or technical knowledge.

## Sounds great
