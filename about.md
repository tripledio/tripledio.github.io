| We don't want to be a big company We want to be a _professional_ company.|
| :-------------|

*Triple D* is a belgian software development company that was founded by a group of veteran software engineers. It's *not* a consulting company, the goal is *not* to sell resources. Triple D's passion is to deliver the software that fits your needs. As fast as possible, without bugs.  Delivering the value you need, now and in the future!

## Our company goal  <a name="2"/>

Our overall driving goal is to deliver high quality, rock SOLID, well designed software. Creating products that will fit your needs and that will pay of their investments for years to come. A challenging job well done, that is what we aim for.


## Our people <a name="3"/>

The one and only part of our company is it's people. That's why we want to be great, all round software engineers. 

#### Practice

 At Triple D we are constantly honing our skills. Seriously. We want to deliver our best work, all the time. *It is not good enough that it works* We take pride in our work and take responsibility for it.

  > We don't cut corners. We don't *"ship shit"*
  
   In order to achieve this high standard, We abide to a set of principles. So that we are able to work fast and steady when it matters.


That's why all *Triple D* professionals are

   + Constantly learning and keeping themselves up to date
   + Continuously practicing their craft
   + Working methodical and disciplined
   
> You don't rise to the level of your expectations, you fall to the level of your training.

#### More then code

In order to create successful software systems a great diversity of skills is needed. *A lot of them are non technical*. Gathering the requirements, fostering collaboration, good design, searching for new insights, working together ... All of these properties are part of the skill set that we are constantly working on. 

So when you hire Triple D, you hire a professional who is well versed in a lot of topics.
   
## Prerequisites  <a name="4"/>

In order to achieve our ambitious goal we believe that there are prerequisites to make this possible.

#### a) A close and honest partnership with our customer. <a name="4.a"/>
   We value open communication more then negotiated contracts. The end goal of a successful partnership is that both partners are pleased with the result. We want to build the software you *need*. Enabling you to continuously reap the benefits from a well designed solution both now and in the *future*. For this open and honest communication is necessary. How else can we built *your* great software *together*?


#### b) Ownership of the development process <a name="4.b"/>
When you hire Triple D, you hire people who have spent a lot of their time in getting proficient in their job. Which is so much more then writing code. Let us own to whole development process. So that we can really deliver.

> We do not offer a one size fits-all solution, we offer a rocket boosted start.

#### c) Direct communication with all stakeholders <a name="4.c"/>
We don't believe in long communication chains and huge documents. We talk to the business, we build software for them, they should be the ones we are talking to.


#### d) Immediate short feedback loops <a name="4.d"/>
   Continuous integration and delivery enables the team to work at full speed. The delivery pipeline allows the customer to see and use the features within minutes after finishing a development iteration. By quickly gathering feedback the delivered product will maximize business value. 
   

## Our services <a name="5"/>

### a) Team as a service <a name="5.a"/>
*Triple D* is a professional software engineering *team* that keeps its coherence over multiple software assignments. Comparable to the romans imperial standing army that was a professional army instead of an ad hoc formed army. This enabled them to keep the lessons learned and experience gained. Just like them we want to keep our team together, keep building on the lessons learned, profit from the close collaboration gained. This allows us to not only continuously improve ourselves but our working as a team as well.

### b) Reinforcement <a name="5.b"/>
Our professionals can work together with your existing teams, introducing industry best practices. Allowing your team to evolve and eventually going faster while still delivering new functionality.

### c) Trainings and workshops <a name="5.c"/>
Whether you
Your company has recently gone through an Agile transformation but you realize that you lack technical skills to improve your code quality and predictability. We can help you make sure that your team keeps delivering at the same pace even long after the initial phase of your project.
