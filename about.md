#Triple D  

Triple D is the company we founded that specializes in *professional software development*. We try to be not your typical IT-consultancy company. In fact we don't try to be a consultancy company at all. Our aim is not to 'sell' as many consultants as possible. Our aim is to deliver the software that fits your need. As fast as possible, with no bugs, and as useful as possible. Now and  in the future.

##History

**Who we are**  

We are a group of *professional software engineers* with each more then a decade of experience in our industry. Over the years ve've worked on all kinds of different projects and teams for all kinds of different companies. In those years we have encountered a lot of the same problems over and over again. In an attempt to do better we've joined forces and founded **Triple D**.

**The problems we see everyday**

###Poor quality
	 + While we don't dispute the fact that developers are trying to do best by their customers. We often run into situations where short term decisions prevale over long term targets causing more damage then actual good. Or worse, limited by their own experience or knowledge.
+ Demand exceeds the supply **Dangerous- anders verwoorden**
    + The demand for technical skilled people outweighs the supply. This allows for a higher influx of people into the tech industry. Unfortunately this does not guarantee an increase of skilled people. After all, it's an "easy" job. If you have some basic coding skills you can easily get a contract, company car,... without putting in to much effort. Too often employers do not have the technical skill set to differentiate the good from the bad software engineers. Or they do not realize the impact a negligent software engineer can have on a software system. (Hint: it's huge!)
+ High cost of software projects
    + Cost a lot, lot of time. Could be done better
    + Often boils down to the overly simplified `ferrari vs dacia` discussion. Testing should not be offered as an option, it's never an option on the car.
+ a company is not it's people **Dangerous- anders verwoorden**
    + A company exists out of many different people. The brand that the company wants to carry out is seldom consistently carried out by its people.  A company often has good competent people. Unfortunately companies often also have some under-performers. The larger a company is the easier it is for those under-performers to hide themselves in the crowd. In the end you hire people, not a company.
+ Dysfunctional teams
    + Software engineers are people, getting people to work together, creating an efficient team is not easy. It seldom happens by change. A dysfunctional team can cost you a lot of money. Software engineers that do not talk to each other, aren't able to work with each other don't to a proper job. Often the wrong thing will be built and the code base will often look like the monster of frankenstein. All different pieces from different people patched together. Not what you wanted or paid for. Obtaining all your external software developers from a single company does not solve this. Worst case is when you need to hire a coach just to get those people to talk to each other.
+ A lot of time and effort in creating good teams
    + A lot of companies recognize the cost of dysfunctional teams. They spend a lot of time and effort trying to create good teams that can deliver your software. Unfortunately this is not easy if the people in the teams have the wrong mindset. If they put their own or their own teams interests before that of their customer, the customer looses. 



**Team as a service**

We started this company because we got tired of battling the same up hill battles year in, year out. Over the years we worked for many different firms with many different software engineers. We encountered a lot of excellent software professionals. Unfortunately they rarely have the change to work together. With Triple D we hope to change this.



**Quality software development**

We strive for quality software design. We want to achieve this by

+ achieving a partnership with our customer.
    + We value open communication higher then negotiated contracts. The end goal of a successful partnership is that both partners are pleased with the result. We want to build the software you *need* and that will enable you from continuously reaping the benefits from the well designed solution in the *future*. For this open and honest communication is a necessity. How else can we built *your* great software *together*?
+ upholding a very high quality standard. 
    + Our craftsmen our constantly honing their skills. Reading books, blogs, attending conferences and technical meetups or simply practicing their programming skills through coding kata's.  We want to our best work, all the time. *It is not good enough that it works* 
+ reap what we have sown
    + 	Since we pack that experience we come with solutions for many problems out of the box. A project setup, a continous integration and delivery pipeline. A lot of pieces of the puzzle are present, others are designed for the customer or updated and refined as we go. It's not a cure-all platform, it's a start with rockets strapped to it.
