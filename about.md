**History**

**The problems we see**

+ Poor quality
+ Demand exceeds the supply **Dangerous- anders verwoorden**
    + The demand for technical skilled people outweighs the supply. This allows for a higher influx of people into the tech industry. Unfortunately this does not guarantee an increase of skilled people. After all, it's an easy jon. If you have some basic coding skills you can easily get a contract, company car,... without putting in to much effort. Too often employers do not have the technical skill set to differentiate the good from the bad software engineers. Or they do not realize the impact a negligent software engineer can have on a software system. (Hint: it's huge!)
+ High cost of software projects
    + Cost a lot, lot of time. Could be done better
+ a company is not it's people **Dangerous- anders verwoorden**
    + A company exists out of many different people. The brand that the company wants to carry out is seldom consistently carried out by its people.  A company often has good competent people. Unfortunately companies often also have some under-performers. The larger a company is the easier it is for those under-performers to hide themselves in the crowd. In the end you hire people, not a company.
+ Dysfunctional teams
    + Software engineers are people, getting people to work together, creating an efficient team is not easy. It seldom happens by change. A dysfunctional team can cost you a lot of money. Software engineers that do not talk to each other, aren't able to work with each other don't to a proper job. Often the wrong thing will be built and the code base will often look like the monster of frankenstein. All different pieces from different people patched together. Not what you wanted or paid for. Obtaining all your external software developers from a single company does not solve this
+ A lot of time and effort in creating good teams
    + A lot of companies recognize the cost of dysfunctional teams. They spend a lot of time and effort trying to create good teams that can deliver your software. Unfortunately this is not easy if the people in the teams have the wrong mindset. If they put their own or their own teams interests before that of their customer, the customer looses. 



**Team as a service**

We started this company because we got tired of battling the same up hill battles year in, year out. Over the years we worked for many different firms with many different software engineers. We encountered a lot of excellent software professionals. Unfortunately they rarely have the change to work together. With Triple D we hope to change this.



**Quality software development**

We strive for quality software design. We want to achieve this by

+ achieving a partnership with our customer.
    + We value open communication higher then negotiated contracts. The end goal of a successful partnership is that both partners are pleased with the result. We want to build the software you *need* and that will enable you from continuously reaping the benefits from the well designed solution in the *future*. For this open and honest communication is a necessity. How else can we built *your* great software *together*?
+ upholding a very high quality standard. 
    + Our craftsmen our constantly honing their skills. Reading books, blogs, attending conferences and technical meetups or simply practicing their programming skills through coding kata's.  We want to our best work, all the time. *It is not good enough that it works*
