# Our History

# Our History <a name="4"/>

## Who we are  <a name="4.a"/>

We are a group of *professional software engineers* with each more then a decade of experience in our industry. Over the years we've worked on all kinds of different projects and teams for all kinds of different companies. In those years we have encountered a lot of the same problems over and over again. In an attempt to do better we've joined forces and founded *Triple D*.

Over the years we worked for many different firms with many different software engineers. We encountered a lot of excellent software professionals. Unfortunately they rarely have the chance to work together. With *Triple D* we hope to give ourselves that change. And providing our customers with a team a highly skilled professionals that can work together as a team from the start.

## The problems in our industry <a name="4.b"/>

#### a) Poor quality
The overall quality of software being developed is unfortunately often poor, it's life expectancy far too low and it's cost way to high. While we don't dispute the fact that software engineers are (often) trying to do their best in delivering valuable software, we unfortunately experience that this is seldomly achieved.

#### b) The demand for software engineers exceeds the supply
The demand for technically skilled people outweighs the supply. This allows for a high influx of people into the tech industry. Unfortunately this does not guarantee an increase of skilled people. After all, it's an "easy" job. If you have some basic coding skills you can easily get a contract, company car,... without putting in to much effort. Too often employers do not have the technical skill set to differentiate the professional from the amateurs. The impact of one negligent software engineer is seldom recognized. The impact on the life cycle of the software, on its maintenance cost, ... (Hint: it's huge!)

#### c) The high cost of software projects
Software is expensive. It costs a lot of money and a lot of time. While we don't want to diminish the complexity and the necessity of this  cost, our experience is that, given the right people, more often then not, it can be done faster and cheaper.

#### d) You hire people, not a company
   A classic misconception people sometime have when hiring a software company is assuming that employees of that company are inter changeable. This can create the illusion that when the software company is big enough, one is secure in having competent people always available.

 Of course we all know that a company consists out of many different people. The brand that the company wants to carry out is seldom consistently carried out by its people. Every company has good, competent people. Unfortunately companies occasionally also have some under-performers in their ranks. The larger a company is, the easier it is for those under-performers to hide themselves in the crowd. In the end you hire people, not a company. In our experience, the bigger a company, the higher the risk you hire an under performer. Even if you start of by receiving one of their top people at the start of your project. As time passes by, and the contract has been secured, the top people can get replaced by one of its colleague's. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. But rarely the company brand policies is present in all the employees.

#### e) Dysfunctional teams
   Software engineers are people, and getting people to work well together, creating an efficient team, is not easy. It seldom happens by chance. It is a problem all kinds of organizations face.

   Due to the not so visible nature of software development a dysfunctional team can cost you a lot of money. Software engineers that do not talk to each other, aren't able to work well with each other can not do a proper job. Even if all of the individuals are highly competent.
   Often the wrong thing will be built, your code base starts to look like a pile of opinions and open ended discussions: different pieces from different people patched together lacking a coherent architecture. Due to the nature of software it takes time for these negative effects to become apparent. While in the mean time a lot of money is being spent, and wasted.

  Of course good teams do exist. Teams that work well and that can really deliver. This is something that usually takes a lot of time and effort. (And money) A lot of companies recognize the cost of dysfunctional teams. That's why they spend a lot of time and effort trying to create good teams. But this is not an easy task.

  When it is achieved, it is also hard to maintain. The team culture is something must be consciously defended. So that it can survive organizational changes. In practice we have rarely encountered great teams that last more then a year.


## Our solutions <a name="4.c"/>


#### a) to "poor quality"
We aim to counter poor software quality by upholding a very high standard. In our software as well as in our colleagues.

#### b) to "Demand exceeds supply"
While of course we can't solve the shortage of technical people, it is our belief that lack of people often isn't the problem. Often you don't need more people. You need the right people. Professionals that can operate as a team. This is what we aim to bring.

#### c) to "A company is not it's people"
We don't want to be a big company. Our business model is not in selling as much consultants as possible. This allows us to uphold our high standard. So that we live up to our values. A job interview takes longer then one hour. Code will be required. People skills are important.

We prefer to not filling a job vacancy over filling it by someone who isn't a fit to our vision.

#### d) to "Dysfunctional teams"
We aim to get rid of the waste of an dysfunctional team, of the time and energy put info forming and maintaining a real team. That is why we offer a 'team as a service' solution. Evidently we are all individual professionals but *Triple D* also aims to be a professional team.


## Origin of the name <a name="4.d"/>

We started using the name *Triple D* as a working title when we started debating the idea of founding our own company. It is on the one hand a reference to the three D's in Domain Driven Design. On the other hand to us, the three founders. When we finally founded the company the name was so engraved in our conversations that another name did not fit the bill. So *Triple D* was born.
