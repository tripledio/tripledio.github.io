# Greenfield software development

## It's a hard world

As software engineers we need to be a jack of all trades. Which is not really a bad thing. We could choose our specializations, but we need to master to some degree a variety of skills. Which I personally think is a good thing. It keeps me interested :P

 When we are developing software, we need to combine many of these different skills. Luckily in this day and age we can find numerous sources (books, blogs, video's, ...) that explain and illustrate specific languages, technologies, techniques... Then it is up to us to take all that information and bring it together. Once we need to apply and integrate many different idea's, techniques with each other, that's when we really move from theory to practice. 

## Green field - brown field

In the real world, most software projects or products we work on are brown field. Software repositories that already existed before we started working on them. Occasionally we get to start on a greenfield project but this happens less frequently. As a result, we are less practiced at it. In a greenfield project, we have the luxury and burden that everything is yet to be decided. We start from a clean slate. This also increases the amount of choices we need to make. Because we want to do it right  of course, knowing that most likely there will be many software developers that will be working in this codebase for years to come.

## Blog Post Series

Since starting a greenfield problem is something we don't do often, I think it could be a good idea to have a series of blog post on this theme. In it I will pick a problem that is complex enough to serve as a value learning tool and then I will build a small application that solves the problem. From start to finish. Along the way using a wide variety of technique's and practices. 

What I hope to do with this blog post series

+ demonstrate how different techniques come together during an actual project
+ how to bring well-known software principles into practice
+ show the importance of some base principles throughout the software development process   

## Topics

The sequential topics in this series will be 

+ 1) Understanding the problem
+ 2) Splitting up the work
+ 3) Up front Design ? 
+ 4) Domain Model
+ 5) Initial code base
+ 6) Development

## My way

I will tackle the problem _my way_. How I personally would approach it at this given point in time (2020). This doesn't mean that this is the only way or the best way. It just means that this is how I currently work. Hopefully I will still improve on this in the future. The hope is that my opinionated "system" can answer some questions you might have. And that doing this series helps me to improve as well :-)
