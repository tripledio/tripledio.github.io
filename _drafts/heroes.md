# Heroes

In this post I would like to talk about a certain type of developer a lot of us probably aspire to be at one point in our career. A type of developer that is often well respected and revered by his peers. And one that is often well known by whatever management there is in place. 

## The hero developer

Something I noticed in almost every company I worked at is that there are always one or more **hero** developers. These hero developers are known by management for

+ Getting things to work fast in face of a looming deadline
+ Saving the day when the shit hits the fan in production
    
As a result of their fearlessness in production and heroic deeds in making deadlines / these developers are often well known and respected by management. These developers throw themselves in the midst of "battle" time and time again. Saving the day. 

To their fellow software developers they are often known 

+ Being very 'smart'
+ Being experts

What would we do without them?

## A couple of questions

Now allow me to play the devils advocate again and ask some questions. In doing so I will be  making some generalizations and simplifications. But over the years I have obtained some reservations with these heroes. Because there is a huge difference between *working as a team to fix a very rare occurrence (deadline, production issue)* and between *having need of hero developers to constantly step in to solve problems*.

When I see *the same* developers on regular basis 

+ working to make some deadline
+ fixing another urgent issues in production
+ always being referred to by their peers
+ being the ones that need to make the final call

then I can help but wondering why? Why are it always the same developers that are in the midst of 'battle'?

> Are the people drawn to the problems or the problems attracted by the people?

Why are it often *the same* people that are drawn to the problems? 
+ Is it for that hero feeling? 
+ For the feeling of being non expendable? 
+ Being important for the customer?
+ Are they the only ones that are competent enough? 
+ Does no one else has the knowledge?

Then of course there are the environmental why's:
+ Why are there constant deadlines to begin with?  
+ Why is it so hard to deliver steadily new features? 

Of course each situation is different and there are many different factors. I am in no way trying to blame someone because they work hard en fix the customers problem. But over the years I have seen many different types of the these heroes. At one time I myself was a certain type of 'hero'. I've seen such heroes burn themselves out, bring teams and projects down. Often with very good intentions. So let me delve into this a bit.

## Wild west

![Gunslingers](/img/posts/heroes/gunslingers.png)

In the case of hero developers I often think of them as the cowboy gunslingers from the wild west. You know, the classic cowboys that draw fast and shoot straight. Who ride in to town, save the day in an epic gun fight. And then ride of in the sunset. As a kid, who did not aspire to be such a hero?

The residents of the town in the wild west are happy when they are saved by this hero. The danger has been averted, evil doers slain. Oh happy days! The gunslinger is loved and admired. Perhaps even worshipped. After a while there can even form a little group centered around the hero gunslinger. The hero that everyone relies on and tries to imitate. Whom is loved by all... 

However what the residents of the town really need is the wild west to be tamed. In the wild west they need to rely on the heroes but they would much prefer it if the heroes were no longer necessary. So that they can continue to steadily work, expand, grow their city. Go about their business and improve their lives. They desire a future where violent episodes never occur again and they can reliably predict the future without needing to live in constant fear.  What they really need, even if they sometimes don't realize it themselves, is a _professional_ reliable law enforcement. One that nips all trouble in the but, well before it occurs. From whom you don't even know that they are there. It is just safe...

Since the software industry is still such a young industry that is frequently revolutionized by the next new thing you could compare it with the wild west. The tech savy experts feel safe there but for others it can be a scary place. In my little wild west comparison the residents of the town are of course the customers that need to rely on the developers. Where they hope for steady predictability and robustness in delivered solutions by professionals, they often need to rely on hero gunslingers. Often they do not know that there is another way..

## Who does not want to be a hero?
   
Like is said before, who doesn't want to be a hero? Just like in the wild west stories, being a hero can be very rewarding. Even in a software development context.

+ Heroes are visible
    Saving the day is much more rewarding then simply doing your job. At least in the short term. In the movies being the hero gunslinger is much better then being the blacksmith or sheriff. The hero gets all the attention and praise. No one aspires to be one who is doing his job, not needing to go into battle. That makes for is a boring story. Stories tell the exceptional.
    
+ Heroes are placed on a pedestal   
    It does not help that heroes often can get worshipped form two sides. Even if that isn't their intention. But
    + From the customer/manager side who, like the citizens, are grateful that the hero cam to their rescue. 
    + From the developer side heroes get relied upon too much. Sometimes a little cult can even form around one person.

## Types of heroes

It is of course impossible to categorize people and their variety of behaviors in a simple post. But I have made an attempt to note down the different types of heroes that I have encountered. So far ;) Note that these heroes don't necessarily have to be experts or very competent. they can be. But it is more about how they view themselves, are viewed by their peers and are viewed by the customers that I use to categorize them. 

|Type of hero | Area of impact | Characteristics                             |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
|Young buck   | Development    | Long hours and weekend work                 |
|             |                | In the midst of deadlines                   |
|Lone ranger  | Production     | The only one who can fix the issues         |
|Delta force  | Production     | Team constant in operational support mode   |
|Dictator     | Development    | Rules by intimidation                       |
|             |                | His will be done                            |
|             |                | Kills initiative                            |
|             |                | Drives away good people                     |
|The genius   | Development    | Worshipped by team                          |
|             |                | A bottleneck for decisions                  |
|             |                | No responsibility or ownership by team      |
|             |                | Drives away good people                     |


### The young buck

This type of 'hero' is for me typically the young naive buck. The young gunslinger full of high ideals, with a simplistic sense of justice, who is doing all the fighting and taking all the risks. But often gets played for a fool and lets someone else reaps the benefit. He might even get scorned and chased away by the very people he was fighting for. 
 
In the software world I have seen these 'young buck' hero typically in a consulting context. The young developers, with little experience, starting with a consultancy firm. They are the ones te most easy to convince that they need to put in the time, work hard, pull late nighters, work in the weekends, to make that big deadline. Often of some fixed-prize waterfall project that was bound to fail from the start. Yes, people still do big waterfall projects. Remember Obama care? [^obama-cio]

The developers that are doing this hard work, rushing from deadline to deadline, often do this from a misplaced sense of pride. Perhaps even a sense of professionalism. Look at us working hard, getting things done. Our company and customer will be so proud... 

It is precisely that sense of taking pride in doing 'heroic' deeds that categorizes them for me as the young buck. I've certainly seen older consultants do yet another project with crazy arbitrary deadlines. But usually they have long lost the pride part and are doing it because it pays the bills or advances their career with the boss. They do it consciously.
    
The young buck hero was for me what Sandro Mancuso discussed in a very recognizable way in chapter 5 of his book [The Software Craftsman](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Craftsman-Professionalism-Pragmatism-Robert/dp/0134052501/) [^sandroBook]. Being a hero may make you feel good about yourself, that you are saving the day, making crazy deadlines, doing a lot of overtime... 

Often the only one who benefits form these heroics is the young bucks boss. Who get's paid by the customer for the work and overtime. Of course often a bone will be thrown towards the ones doing the actual work. But it isn't the boss that is sitting there in the weekends, pulling an all nighter...

Even if the deadline is met the customer is often left with very poorly written software which a high maintenance cost. Did I mention Obama care[^obama-cbs] ? I could of course mention a lot of belgian projects, companies as well.

|Party|Problem|
|------------------|----------|
|Young buck | Being exploited high cost on social life |
| | High cost on social life |
| | A job not well done |
| | Not improving their craft|
|Team member| If they do not take part in the heroics, they can be looked upon with disdain. |
||If they do take part, they are part of the problem |
|The boss|If there is a party between the customer and the developers, they are the ones that 'gain' something form this. At the risk of loosing their reputation. 
||If the boss and the paying customer are one and the same. Then it is just a sad story...|
|Paying customer| Left with crapy software and false promises. |
|Delivered solution|Unmaintable, untested software |

    
### The lone ranger 
 
Another type of heroes is a person who is more of loner. They get the job done by themselves, the work long hours, deadlines by themselves. Always on call, always there when the shits hit the fan. They are the lone ranger that always saves the day. But no one really knows what is going on. This is one I have come across on several occasions as well. It was almost always the case the hero was barely keeping everything a float. Due to a lack of knowledge, discipline, or ability to say no, things have gotten out of control. The lone ranger often runs the risk for a burnout Which is especially dangerous since he can't be missed.
   
### Delta Force    
    
This is essentially the same this as the lone ranger. But now in a team context. When you have a team that is constantly 'fixing' things. Things that no one else knows about. If most of the teams time is spent on operational problems.
    
    --- production heroics --
    First let me make it clear that these 'heroes' are not professionals. Not even if they make the deadline. Because it is more important _how_ a job was done, than that the job was done. Heroics shouldn't come into play, heroes should not be necessary, the day should not _need_ saving. While it may be a heroic thing to do, it would have been better if it never was necessary. That it was just boring steadiness. No heroic battles...
     
    > If you need constant saving by heroes, you might consider hiring some professionals
      
    Of course sometimes things can still go wrong in production. An urgent intervention can be needed. But this should really be an exceptional case. And when it does happen, it should be dealt with swiftly. With a thorough post morten so that we learn how to avoid this in the future, making sure _it does not happen again_. Because we don't want to let the exceptional become the normal.
    
### The Deity 

When people rely on someone, give much weight to their opinions, delegate their judgement to them, placing them onto a pedestal, this runs the risk of the heroes to lose objectivity themselves. Even if the heroes have the best of intentions, and not all heroes necessarily do, it is hard to not get too full of yourselves. It will not only stifle the heroes own growth because they are not being challenged but it also runs the risk of making grave errors. The heroes can get lazily in their thinking, get to used to 'being right'. The ego gets inflated. And no matter how good they are, they become less valuable...

A little mental check that I often do with people is checking if I ever heard someone admitting that they where wrong. If I saw them changed their minds by someones else argument. If someone can never admit a mistake or change their mind by someone else arguments... I automatically place little value on their opinion. 

> They are not trying to help, they are trying to win...

It is normal that people argue and defend their points of view. To a certain point. We all have this to some degree. But if someone is truly incapable to decouple their ego from their solution then it is impossible to have a meaningful conversation. Their ego does not permit them to admit that they are not omniscient. So there is really no point in debating them. Unfortunately depending on their hero status in a group, this may be unavoidable. If the deity hero has a hero cult around them, then you even got a bigger problem: [The hero cult](#hero-cult). 


### Why you should avoid working together with heroes
    
+ In the heroes we trust - people
    Having heroes in your teams runs the additional risk that after a while the hero is no longer questioned. Because the heroes know best, we shouldn't question them. Just follow the leader of the pack. But we are all humans.
     
    >No one can know everything, think of everything or is infallible. 
  
  So we need everyone to pitch in, using all the capacity available to us. 
   
+ In the heroes shadow - people potential

    When there are heroes around, people often don't take ownership themselves. They feel secure in the presence of heroes. Or intimidated. They run the risk of becoming complacent, just following along, not challenging the leader but also not challenging themselves, no responsibility needs to be taken. People run the risk of not living up to their own full potential. This way, heroes often block the team members from using the full potential. Which is not only a waste but also dangerous.
     
     Decisions can get postponed until they get approval by a hero. Because people don't want to make the decision, take the responsibility themselves. Or a decision taken when the hero was absent can be immediately overturned when the hero returns. Making sure that no decision will be taken next time. This not only starts resembling a dictatorship but it turns the hero into a bottleneck. 
     
     Because even if you should have some infallible IT-heroes, they can not be everywhere at the same time. The team needs to ready and competent to handle everything without the heroes being around.
     
    
+ Hero Cult - people political [hero-cult]

    Heroes also can complicate the political landscape. It can happen that a little cult of followers starts forming around one person. That is a dangerous thing politically. It adds the additional political complexity that next to the existing organizational silo's often present in a organisation, there is an additional political group that can possibly run across organizational boundaries. In this case the leader of the hero cult may gain more power than the organization/ customer is willing to give to them. For 
    
 

+ Professional will leave
    
    
## What we should strive for
    
+ No need for interventions
    The shit should not hit the fan!
+ Professional is expendable -> manifesto
+ No bottlenecks
+ The best solution possible, regardless whose idea it was.



Ego, intelligence

The smartest people I know:

1. Admit they know very little
2. Constantly seek more info
3. Encourage intellectual debate
4. Have strong opinions, loosely held
5. Are comfortable being wrong
6. Surrounded by best people
7. Realize life isn't black & white
8. Fear bias & arrogance

Customer worhsips them, doesn't know it can be done different
Heroes are more visible, get all the glory

## The problems with heroes
So what is exactly the problem? Well, just like I see several types of heroes I see several types of problems.

+ A problem for the heroes themselves
+ A problem for the teams to which the heroes belong
+ A problem for the delivered solutions
+ A problem for the paying customer

|Hero | none |

### Why you shouldn't aim to be a hero
