# Intro

In this post I would like to talk about a certain type of developer a lot of us aspire to be at one point. A type of developer that is often well respected and revered by his peers. And who is often well known by whatever management there is in place. 

# Hero developers

Something I noticed in almost any company I worked is that there are always one or more **hero** developers. These hero developers are developers that are known for
    + Getting things to work fast in face of a looming deadline
    + Saving the day when the shit hits the fan in production
    
As a result of their fearlessness in production and heroic deeds in making deadlines / these developers are often well known and respected by management.
    
These developers throw themselves in the midst of "battle" time and time again. Saving the day. 

What would we do without them?

# A couple of why's

Now allow me to play the devils advocate and make some large generalizations. But i often have some reservations with these heroes. Because there is a huge difference between working as a team to fix a very rare occurrence (deadline, production issue) and between having hero developers to constantly step in to solve the problems.

When I see *the same* developers on regular basis 
+ working to make some deadline
+ fixing another urgent issues in production
+ **TODO** Other examples? 
 
When I notice that it are always the same developers that are in the midst of 'battle', I can help but wondering why?

> Are the people drawn to the problems or the problems attracted by the people?

Why are it often *the same* people that are drawn to the problems? 
+ Is it for that hero feeling? Mancuso
+ For the feeling of being non expendable? 
+ Being important for the customer?
+ Are they the only ones that are competent enough? Does no one else has the knowledge?

Then of course here are the environmental why's:
+ Why are there constant deadlines to begin with?  
+ Why is it so hard to deliver steadily new features? 

Of course each situation is different and there are many different factors. But these are some of the why's i always ask my self in order to determine the root of the problem.

In the case of hero developers i often think of them as Gunslingers from the wild west.

# Wild west

Quick, flashy vs professional
No need for interventions
Professional is expendable -> manifesto

The shit should not hit the fan!
