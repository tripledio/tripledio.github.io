# Heroes

In this post I would like to talk about a certain type of developer a lot of us probably aspire to be at one point in our career. A type of developer that is often well respected and revered by his peers. And one that is often well known by whatever management there is in place. 

## The hero developer

Something I noticed in almost every company I worked at is that there are always one or more **hero** developers. These hero developers are known by management for

+ Getting things to work fast in face of a looming deadline
+ Saving the day when the shit hits the fan in production
    
As a result of their fearlessness in production and heroic deeds in making deadlines / these developers are often well known and respected by management. These developers throw themselves in the midst of "battle" time and time again. Saving the day. 

To their fellow software developers they are often known 

+ Being very 'smartest'
+ Being experts

What would we do without them?

## A couple of questions

Now allow me to play the devils advocate again and ask some questions. In doing so I will be  making some generalizations and simplifications. But over the years I have obtained some reservations with these heroes. Because there is a huge difference between *working as a team to fix a very rare occurrence (deadline, production issue)* and between *having need of hero developers to constantly step in to solve problems*.

When I see *the same* developers on regular basis 

+ working to make some deadline
+ fixing another urgent issues in production
+ always being referred to by their peers
+ the once that need to make the final call

then I can help but wondering why? Why are it always the same developers that are in the midst of 'battle'?

> Are the people drawn to the problems or the problems attracted by the people?

Why are it often *the same* people that are drawn to the problems? 
+ Is it for that hero feeling? 
+ For the feeling of being non expendable? 
+ Being important for the customer?
+ Are they the only ones that are competent enough? 
+ Does no one else has the knowledge?

Then of course here are the environmental why's:
+ Why are there constant deadlines to begin with?  
+ Why is it so hard to deliver steadily new features? 

Of course each situation is different and there are many different factors. I am in no way trying to blame someone because they work hard en fix the customers problem. But these are some of the why's i always ask my self in order to determine the root of the problem. Because their is a problem in my opinion. 

## Wild west

In the case of hero developers i often think of them as the cowboy gunslingers from the wild west. You know, the classic cowboys that draw fast and shoot straight. Who ride in to town, save the day in an epic gun fight. And then ride of in the sunset. As a kid, who did not aspire to be such a hero?

The residents of the town in the wild west are happy when they are saved by this hero. The danger has been averted, evil doers slain. The gunslinger is loved and perhaps even worshipped. After a while there can even form a little group centered around the hero gunslinger. The hero that everyone relies on and tries to imitate. Whom is loved by all... 


However what he residents of the town really is the wild west to be tamed. They need to rely on the heroes but they would prefer it if the heroes were no longer necessary. That way they can continue to steadily work, expand, improve and grow their city. They desire a future where violent episodes never occur again and they can reliably predict the future without needing to live in constant in fear.  What they really need, even if they sometimes don't realize it themselves, is a _professional_ reliable law enforcement that nips all trouble in the but, well before it occurs.

In my little wild west comparison the residents of the town are of course the customers that need to rely on the developers. Where they hope for steady predictability and robustness in delivered solutions by professionals, they often need to rely on hero gunslingers. Often they do not know that there is another way...
 

## Who does not want to be a hero?
   
Like is said before, who doesn't want to be a hero? Just like in the wild west stories, being a hero can be very rewarding. Even in a software development context.

+ Heroes are visible
    Saving the day is much more rewarding then simply doing your job. At least in the short term. In the movies being the hero gunslinger is much better then being the blacksmith or sheriff. The hero gets all the attention and praise. No one aspires to be one who is doing his job, not needing to go into battle. Because that is a boring story.
+ Heroes are placed on a pedestal   
    It does not help that heroes can get worshipped form two sides. 
    + From the customer/manager side who, like the citizens, are grateful that the hero cam to their rescue. 
    + From the developer side heroes get relied upon too much. Sometimes a little cult can even form around one person.

## The problems
So what is exactly the problem? Well there are several.

+ Heroes are not professionals 
    First let me make it clear the heroes are not professionals. As Sandro Mancuso explains this in a very recognizable way in chapter 5 of his book [The Software Craftsman](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Craftsman-Professionalism-Pragmatism-Robert/dp/0134052501/) [^sandroBook], being a hero may make you feel good about yourself, that you are saving the day, making crazy deadlines, doing a lot of overtime... it isn't professional. After all, heroes should not be necessary. The day shouldn't need saving. While it may be a heroic thing to do, it would have been better if it never was necessary. Of course sometimes things can still go wrong. But it should be really exceptional. 
    
    > If you need constant saving by heroes, you might consider hiring some professionals
+ Heroes are not questioned
    It is a dangerous thing once there starts forming a little cult of followers around one person. People don't take ownership, the feel secure in the presence of the hero and don't question. They become complacent, just following the leader of the pack without questioning. They don't live up to their own full potential in the shadow of the hero. Often by choice. 
+ It can hide incompetence
    
    
## What we should strive for
    
+ No need for interventions
    The shit should not hit the fan!
+ Professional is expendable -> manifesto
+ No bottlenecks
+ The best solution possible, regardless whose idea it was.



Ego, intelligence

The smartest people I know:

1. Admit they know very little
2. Constantly seek more info
3. Encourage intellectual debate
4. Have strong opinions, loosely held
5. Are comfortable being wrong
6. Surrounded by best people
7. Realize life isn't black & white
8. Fear bias & arrogance

Customer worhsips them, doesn't know it can be done different
Heroes are more visible, get all the glory
