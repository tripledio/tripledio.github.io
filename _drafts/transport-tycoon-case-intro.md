# A greenfield software development

## It's a hard world

As software engineers we need to be a jack of all trades. Which is not really a bad thing. We could choose our specializations, but we need to master to some degree a variety of skills. Which I personally think is a good thing. It keeps me interested :P

 When we are developing software, we need to combine many of these different skills. Luckily in this day and age we can find numerous sources (books, blogs, video's, ...) that explain and illustrate specific languages, technologies, techniques... Then it is up to us to take all that information and bring it together. Once we need to apply and integrate many different idea's, techniques with each other, that's when we really move from theory to practice. 

## Blog Post Series

Therefore I think it could be a good idea to have a series of blog post on this theme. I will pick a problem that is complex enough to serve as a value learning tool. For which I will then build a small application from start to finish. Solving the problem using a wide variety of technique's and practices. 

What I hope to do with this blog post series

+ demonstrate how different techniques come together during an actual project
+ how to bring well-known software principles into practice
+ the importance of some base principles throughout the software development process   

## Topics

The sequential topics in this series will be 

+ 1) Understanding the problem
+ 2) Splitting up the work
+ 3) Up front Design ? 
+ 4) Domain Model
+ 5) Initial code base
+ 6) Development

## My way

I will tackle the problem _my way_ at this given point in time (2020). This doesn't mean that this is the only way or the best way. It just means that this is how I currently work. Hopefully I will still improve on this in the future. The hope is that my opinionated "system" can answer some questions you might have. And that it helps me improve as well :-)
