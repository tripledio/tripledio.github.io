# Intro

The metaphor that is probably most used for explaining, comparing software issues is the construction of buildings. It is also all too often that the metaphor falls short and doesn't really address the problem sufficiently. So when recently there was an item in the news concerning problems with the constructed government buildings in Brussel, it stayed with me. Because that real life issue seemed to me to be an excellent example of one of the well known problems that plagues software development. So bare with me for yet another construction metaphor.
