# DDD for everyone

## DDD is known

## DDD reputation

### Only for big projects

### Too academic
    + monads
    + functional programming
    + how to apply?
### Not practical

### Zealots, religion

    + Don't fear the DDD police
    + Just a yellow sticky
    + Dangers of a book
    + Don't be a zealot
        + iteration still matter

## DDD is needed

    + low quality software
        + anemic domain model
    + distributed ball of muds
    + task driver development
    + little or no design
    + database still centre of the world
    + too much code before thinking
    
    + make something that solves the domain specific problem
    not driven by the tools at hand
    
    + deisgn decisions guided by short time developer convenience, not by what is needed.
   
## But what is DDD

The goal is the create software that is valuably involved in users activities.

### It is all connected
    + not about aggregates, value object 

## Value of DDD    

### real complexity in the domain

"There are many things that make software development complex. But the heart of the complexity lies in the problem domain itself." -- Martin Fowler

"Tackling complexity in heart of software"


### Value across applications

    + system thinking
    + data central thinking
    + team organization
    + domains bounded contexts
    + this impacts you!
    + boundaries! Can't fix everything at once.
    
### Value inside applications

    + architecture
    + microservices
    + implemenattion matter, Clean, well crafted code => battling omplexity.
    + domain models!
        "The key to controlling complexity is a good domain model" -- Martin Fowler
        Not a data model!
        + 
        + The model is the backbone of the language used by all team mebers
        + The model is distilled knowledge
        
            
    
## Make it practical

    + Lower the bar
    + monoids with beer
    + Secure by design
    
### Design 

    + if it fits in your head, you can get away with it
        + rarely the case [picture of drawer with little in it]        
    + language discover concepts
        + so much more then ubiquitous
        + look for clear definitions
            + write them down
        + don't 'assume" people now
    + take the time to think
        + screw the "estimated" time for the post
        + it is not the typing
    + it is not the typing that is important
    + It is not CEO knowledge but developers undertstanding that gets deployed!
            + so very true
    
### In code
    
    + Code matters        
    + Naming  
        + akward namings, undiscovered concept   
    + separate from technical concerns

### api's
    + It's all about dependencies
    + Hide internals!
        + again basic software principals    
    + tell the what, not the how
    + Shop, don't care how the bread is baked or the sausages get made
        + yet we gave the buther knife and point to the barn
    
### Architecture    
    + every developer should know the architecture of its applications
    + draw it
    + know the idea's, the why. Not because it's from authority
                
### Event storming
    + easy technique
    + high treshold to just do it
    + just stickies
    + get better a people interactions
    + no magic
    + overview!
    + understand the story
    
    
## Conclusion

The value of DDD lies in the spirit/mentality of crafting the right solution for a given the problem within a domain.
The techniques are secondary and subject to change. In servitude of the goals. So don't get hung on the theory. Shu Ha Ri. Make it work.

The same applies to the technologies: The database is a detail, the frameworks are details, they are means to an end.   

Fight cognitive overload. This is a mindset that can be applied everywhere. regardless from specific DDD techniques.
