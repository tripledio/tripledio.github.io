# The lone ranger

**Still in need of refactor by guido**
 
*This post belongs to small series of posts. The main post is [Wild west heroes](/20/05/2018/Heroes/).*
 
Here I'll go into a bit more detail what I identify as the **Lone ranger** "hero" pattern.  As the name suggest the lone ranger is someone who mostly operates alone. Lone rangers get the job done by themselves and are always there to save the day. The day, of course, needs constant saving. Some rangers take pride in their heroic actions, others would very much like to put an end to the necessity of it and live a quiet happy life. If they only could.

The **lone ranger** is a type of heroic behaviour encountered in production environments. The **lone rangers** are the software engineers that are always on call, always there when the shits hit the fan. Apart from them no one really knows what is going on. All of which makes them indispensable. 

I have encountered the most examples of this type of 'hero' in the consultancy world. For many clients there was often a single IT consultant responsible for a customer, handling everything of a certain system. This is a type of 'hero' that I have come across on several occasions as well. It was almost always the case that the hero was barely keeping everything afloat, trying to catch a break, keeping up the illusion for the customer that everything is under control, hoping that eventually everything will quiet down or that they can pass the client along to one of their colleagues. Before things fall further apart. Since they are the only ones working for the client it is often the case that no one else really knows how bad the situation is.

How does such a situation come to pass? I've seen it through a variety of reasons. Lack of technical, engineering knowledge was certainly a huge factor in this. An attribute that the customer themselves are often unable to judge correctly. But even with great technical expertise one could fall into this trap. If there is simply too much work, too much knowledge for one person, one needs to start applying "quick fixes". the equivalent of wrapping it up with some duck-tape. Hoping to fix it "later". For which there is of course no time and over time layers of ducktape cover each other. Making the lone rangers and their knowledge indispensable. Even if they would rather not be.

In my personal experience with **lone rangers** I sometimes had to assist them, often had to take over from them. On occasion I found myself of become one myself by heritage. Which at first I didn't mind. Especially in the early days of my career (God, that makes me sound old :( )) I got a certain rush and pride from it when multiple customers were frequently calling me. At the same time I knew that this wasn't a sustainable way. Nor was the software delivered something to be proud of. Poor customers. Poor software...  

> If you need constant saving, you might consider hiring some professionals

The situation is not only dire for the customer and the poor software. The lone rangers themselves often runs the risk for a burnout. Which is especially dangerous since they can't be missed. They are often revered by the customer, since they are the ones saving the day. But that is a sentiment that often passes over time as the customer gets tired of the never ending problems.

Of course sometimes things can still go wrong in production. An urgent intervention can be needed. But this should really be an exceptional case. And when it does happen, it should be dealt with swiftly. With a thorough post morten so that we learn how to avoid this in the future, making sure _it does not happen again_. Because we don't want to let the exceptional become the normal.


## Conclusion

The **lone rangers** may look like they have everything under control. But things are brewing beneath the surface. And it will inevitably explode. If this is not on our radar we very well could make the evening news on some idle thursday. Beware! Make sure we know what is going one. Exceptional interventions should be very exceptional. **Chaos should not be the norm!**
