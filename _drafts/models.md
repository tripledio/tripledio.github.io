# About models...
## What's in a name?

In it we have several overused words. Terms that are used so often that without context they have no real meaning. Service is obviously one of them. But today i would like to talk about models. Because the meaning here is also very context dependent

Model something. Train models

## Classic types of model

+ View Model
+ Data Model
+ Domain model

They are not the same.

## The M in MVC

Rant coming...

## The MVC architecture - the anemic domain model
 Lohgic in services (services again). The data in the 'domain model' which is nothing more then the data model that is mapped by the orm (th M from mapping one model into another)
