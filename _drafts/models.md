# About models...

In Ithe software industry we have several overused words. Words that are used so often, that without proper context, they can cause a lot of confusion. An obvious example of this is the term *service*. A valid term, more so when compared to the word *manager* or *util* (Shivers). The word service actually has meaning. But the context must provided. Is it an application service? domain service? micro service? Or a "I contain all the logic that really should be in my objects" service (a.k.a. anemic domain service). These are all different things.

In this post i would like to address another one of these overused words: **Models** Because the meaning of the word model is also very context dependent. Too often one is wrongly used and thus wrongly implemented. Which has real consequences. It is not just about the semantics.

## What's in a name?



Model something. Train models

## Classic types of model

+ View Model
+ Data Model
+ Domain model
+ Command model
+ Read model

They are not the same.

## One model

## The M in MVC

Rant coming...

## The MVC architecture - the anemic domain model
 Logic in services (services again). The data in the 'domain model' which is nothing more then the data model that is mapped by the orm (th M from mapping one model into another)
