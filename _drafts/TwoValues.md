# Intro

The metaphor that is probably most used for explaining, comparing software issues is the construction of buildings. It is also all too often that the metaphor falls short and doesn't really address the problem sufficiently. So when recently there was an item in the news concerning problems with the constructed government buildings in Brussel, it stayed with me. Because that real life issue seemed to me to be an excellent example of one of the well known problems that plagues software development. So bare with me for yet another construction metaphor.

# Throw away real estate

The article [^article] that stuck with me reported on the fact that buildings that were merely 20 years old needed to be demolished again. Apparently in Brussels there were plenty of throw-away buildings. A lot of then payed for by the government. 

For example the buildings around north station. These were put down for just one purpose: office space. According to the the article this was done in order to maximize profit. It fulfills it original purpose. But nothing more.

The needs of a city change overtime. Once they do and the buildings no longer fulfill their original purpose it is impossible to give them another purpose. Because they were not build with modification in mind. Their structure is so rigid that the only option left is to demolish them and build new buildings that can fulfill the new functionality. Which is a terrible waste of time, money and resources. The only ones that gain from this is are the construction firms that get to rebuild buildings on a frequent base.

A lot of architects and European civil servants realize that this needs to change. Together they want to aim for purpose-free buildings. Buildings that can serve different purposes. Buildings that can be modified and repurposed. 

The article remarks that it is the job of the architect to "build for eternity". To take into account that the original purpose can and will change. A good architecture makes it possible to easily perform modifications in the future. The components used in building could even possible be reused if they aren't glued (literally) together.

# Software Industry

By now it is probably obvious where I'm going with this. Because in software industry we are constantly fighting the same fight. The last paragraph concerning the role of an architect could just as well apply to a software architect, whatever that may be ;).

"How it is done is as important as getting it done."

How it is done is MORE important
