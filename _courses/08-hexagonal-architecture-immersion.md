# Hexagonal Architecture immersion
In today's world software gets written at an incredible pace. Every day, new software is put in production all over the world. However, as time progresses we realize that maintaining that code becomes harder and harder. Why is that? What makes this software so hard to maintain? 

This course will introduce you to the SOLID principles. These principles acts as a guidance while developing and will help you to write better code. As we progress through these principles we will start noticing that these principles apply at different levels: SOLID applied at component level becomes the basis for component design, SOLID applied at an architectural level results into clean architecture.

After our introduction into the SOLID principles, we will guide you while building an application using the ports and adapters architecture. We will do this in a real codebase, so bring your favorite laptop, as this course will be hands-on.

## Contents
+ SOLID principles
+ Component design
+ Ports and Adapters 

## Intended audience
This course will be hands-on, so coding experience will be needed. We provide you with an initial code base to start from and at the end of the course we hope to have a somewhat working application.

## Duration
This course takes at minimum 1 day, 2 days is even better, this allows us to go more in depth during the hands-on sessions. Obviously, we can tailor the contents of this course to better suit your needs. Did we mention we also give workshops on other topics? Maybe a combination would suit your organization better, [contact us](/contact/), and let's see how we can help you!

## Sounds great
