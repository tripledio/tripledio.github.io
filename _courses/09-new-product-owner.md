# The "new Product Owner" Workshop

### Description

In this workshop 'The new PO' will constantly throw requirements your way. It's up to you to let your application grow. Preferably guided by good practices and disciplines to help you with keeping up the pace. The aim is the make the PO as much money as possible. You know, that "value" thing. The amount of money you make will be determined by the speed of feature delivery and the approval rating of your users (no bugs).

This is a hands-on workshop where you compete against others. You will *NOT* be evaluated based on your code but by the product value of your application. So you are free to use any programming language or coding practice you want. The goal of the workshop is to focus on development technique, not on technology. So who will win? The Tortoise or the Hare?
