# The new Product Owner Workshop

### Description

In this workshop 'The new PO' will constantly throw requirements your way. It's up to you to let your application grow, guided by good practices and disciplines to help you with keeping up the pace. You want to make as much money as possible. The speed of feature delivery and the approval of your users (no bugs) will determine the amount you make.

This is a hands-on workshop where you compete against others. You will *NOT* be evaluated based on your code but by the product value of your application. The goal of the workshop is to focus on development technique, not on technology. So you should be able to to everything with coding skills.
