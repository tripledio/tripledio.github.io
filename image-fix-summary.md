# Service Icons Fix Summary

## Issue
The service icons for "Team as a service", "Reinforcement", and "Trainings and workshops" were broken (invisible) on the homepage.

## Root Cause
After investigation, I found that the SVG files for these services existed in the correct locations, but they all had white fill colors. Since they were being displayed on a white background, the icons were invisible, making them appear broken.

## Solution
I updated the fill colors in the SVG files to match their respective service colors:

1. **Team as a service** (team.svg)
   - Changed fill color from `#FFFFFF` (white) to `#ed1c24` (red)
   - This matches the "red" color specified in the services.json file

2. **Reinforcement** (reinforcement.svg)
   - Changed fill color from `#FFFFFF` (white) to `#8ac742` (green)
   - This matches the "green" color specified in the services.json file

3. **Trainings and workshops** (training.svg)
   - Changed fill color from `#FFFFFF` (white) to `#00abf5` (blue)
   - This matches the "blue" color specified in the services.json file

## Files Modified
- `/img/team.svg`
- `/img/reinforcement.svg`
- `/img/training.svg`

## Result
The service icons should now be visible on the homepage, with each icon appearing in its respective service color. This provides a more cohesive visual experience that aligns with the color scheme used throughout the site.
