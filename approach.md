  title: Our approach
  text: In order to achieve our ambitious goal we believe that there are certain prerequisites in order to make this possible.

    description: Triple D is a professional software engineering team that keeps its coherence over multiple software assignments. We belief that this is how we can have the greatest impact.<br /><br />This is comparable to the roman imperial standing army, which was a professional army instead of an ad hoc formed army. This enabled the romans to keep the hard fought lessons learned and experience gained.

    description: Triple D can be brought in as a reinforcement. Working closely together with existing teams allows us to introduce industry best practices. This will not only help in delivering in the short term but it will allow the existing teams to learn, to evolve and to grow. So even after Triple D has left, your teams should deliver faster, quality software. At a sustainable pace.

    description: We can help you to elevate your software delivery process by facilitating training and workshops on request. Assisting you in taking your team to the next level and making sure that the software keeps delivering long after the initial phase or deadline has passed.

    <h3 class="h5 font-family-bold text-black mb-2">A close and honest partnership with our customer</h3>
    <p>We value open communication more then negotiated contracts. The end goal of a successful partnership is that both partners are pleased with the result. We want to build the software you need. Enabling you to continuously reap the beneﬁ ts from a well designed solution both now and in the future. Therefore open and honest communication is necessary. How else can we built your great software together?</p>

    <h3 class="h5 font-family-bold text-black mb-2">Ownership of the development process</h3>
    <p>When you hire Triple D, you hire people who have spent a lot of their time in getting proﬁ cient in their job. A job that is so much more than writing code. So let us own the whole development process. That way we can really deliver.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-12 col-md-8 offset-md-2 mb-2 mb-md-4">
    <h3 class="h5 font-family-bold text-black mb-2">Direct communication with all stakeholders</h3>
    <p>We don’t believe in long communication chains and huge documents. We talk to the business, we build software for them, they should be the ones we are talking to.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-12 col-md-8 offset-md-2 mb-2 mb-md-4">
    <h3 class="h5 font-family-bold text-black mb-2">Immediate short feedback loops</h3>
    <p>Continuous integration and continuous delivery enables the team to work at full speed. A good delivery pipeline also allows the customer to see and use the features within minutes after ﬁ nishing a development iteration. This enables the team to quickly gather feedback on the delivered product, pivot if necessary and constantly go for maximum business value.</p>
