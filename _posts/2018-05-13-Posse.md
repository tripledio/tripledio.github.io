# The posse

**Still in need of refactor by guido**

__considered heroes by themselves, critical saves in production, team bonding, outsiders don't really know what is going on__

*This post belongs to small series of posts. The main post is [Wild west heroes](/20/05/2018/Heroes/).*
 
In this post I'll discuss the Posse "hero" pattern. In the wild west a posse is a group of people summoned to assist law enforcement, or to constitute a search party. The image that I would like to use for descriptive purposes is the posse as an armed, rowdy bunch of cowboys that have taken justice in to their own hands. They have thrown themselves in the midst of trouble, are loyal to each other and stick together. But overtime they can lose track of the original purpose of their actions. Constantly in the heat of battle, they have no time to think how they can prevent future troubles.

Just like the [Lone Rangers](/12/05/2018/LoneRanger/) and [Young Bucks](/12/05/2018/YoungBuck/), some posses take pride in their heroics actions. Others are doing it because they don't see an alternative any more. Depending on how long a posse runs they can be initially viewed as heroes but run the risk that over time people will start seeing them as a necessary evil that they much rather get rid of.

**Posse formation**

I encountered and have been part of posses on frequent occasions. In software a posse forms often through a software team that is under pressure. Whether it is for building new software or maintaining crucial legacy systems, they are working on important, crucial things. This outside pressure has made a core of the original team step up to tackle the problems. This tightning their bound and allowing them to depend on each other. 

When you have a team working hard for a prolonged period of time to make that deadline, chances are good that a posse will form. It is only natural. People stick together and battle forms bonds. Even software battles. In itself there is nothing wrong with that. 

**Posse problems**

The fact that a posse needed to be formed is what was originally wrong. A posse starts to become a problem once they start seeing themselves as heroes, and peers who aren't part of their core group as outsiders. 

The posse has much of the same problems the lone ranger and young bucks have. But in group context. 

When you have a team that is constantly 'fixing' things. Things that no one else knows about. When the team spent most of their time on operational problems, then there is a serious problem. A problem that should be addressed asap. before it makes the evening news... 

 

The team context adds an additional problem to it as the political weight, the pressure that a group can excert on their peers is now a factor. Where this was not the case with the lone rangers.
 
If the posse team consists out of the same people that developed the systems in the first place then the problem is even bigger. Because then you are effectively paying  the outlaws to maintain the order in town... 

This pattern is actually quite dangerous. Because the impact of an entire team on software is larger than that of an individual. A posse ofte will probably also stick together so it is not easy to make changes gradually. 

+ The **lone ranger** and **posse** may look like they have everything under control. But things are brewing beneath the surface. And it will inevitably explode. If this is not on our radar we very well make the evening news on some idle thursday. Beware! Make sure we know what is going one. Exceptional interventions should be very exceptional. Chaos should not be the norm!
