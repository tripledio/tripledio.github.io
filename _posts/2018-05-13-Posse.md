# The posse

**Still in need of refactor by guido**

__considered heroes by themselves, critical saves in production, team bonding, outsiders don't really know what is going on__

*This post belongs to small series of posts. The main post is [Wild west heroes](/20/05/2018/Heroes/). In this post I'll go into a bit more detail what I identify as the Posse "hero" pattern.*

The posse is a rowdy bunch that has taken justice in their own hands. They have thrown themselves in the midst of things. They are loyal to each other and stick together. But they can lose track of the purpose of their actions. Constantly in the midst of things they have no time to think how they can prevent future troubles.

Just like [Lone Rangers](/12/05/2018/LoneRanger/), some posses take pride in their heroics actions. Others are doing it because they don't see an alternative. Depending on how long a posse runs they can be viewed initially as heroes but run the risk that over time people start seeing them as a necessary evil that they much rather get rid of.

The posse is essentially the same this as the lone ranger but now it occurs in a team context. When you have a team that is constantly 'fixing' things. Things that no one else knows about. When most of the teams time is spent on operational problems, then there is a serious problem. A problem that should be addressed asap. before it makes the evening news...
 
If the posse team consists out of the same people that developed the systems in the first place then the problem is even bigger. Because then you are effectively paying  the outlaws to maintain the order in town... 

This pattern is actually quite dangerous. Because the impact of an entire team on software is larger than that of an individual. A posse ofte will probably also stick together so it is not easy to make changes gradually. 

+ The **lone ranger** and **posse** may look like they have everything under control. But things are brewing beneath the surface. And it will inevitably explode. If this is not on our radar we very well make the evening news on some idle thursday. Beware! Make sure we know what is going one. Exceptional interventions should be very exceptional. Chaos should not be the norm!
