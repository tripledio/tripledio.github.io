# The bully

**Still in need of refactor by guido**

__considered heroic by peers/customer , expert/guru, dungeon master , stiffle growth, unsafe environment__

*This post belongs to small series of posts. The main post is [Wild west heroes](/20/05/2018/Heroes/). In this post I'll go into a bit more detail what I identify as the Local "hero" pattern.*

The bully often goes hand in hand with the legendary gunslinger. Depending if you oppose/disagree with them, heroes can become bullies, ruling by brute force and by the political weight that was given to them. After all who would dare to go against the will of the hero of the people.

> A hero to some, a bully to others

While often feared instead of loved by his peers, the terrorizing gunslinger still appears a hero to the people of the town. Their heroes still get the job done and the townspeople care about the results. They don't need to collaborate with gunslinger themselves. So the bullies remain 'in power' by the approval of the townspeople in the one hand, and by intimidating and belitteling any potential contenders.


The bully is the type of 'hero' you get when you get someone that uses their power to bully those that do not follow suit. If one is lauded as the hero that saved the day often enough, then it is possible to assume that you're always right.

Software developers don't hold quick drawing contests but they have their own ways of trying to show who's boss. Typically this is done by demonstrating superior knowledge on some technical field. A framework, language, technology... Even if one doesn't really have deep knowledge, make a lot of noise , spouting some buzz words and professing that the opposing party is a \[insert derogatory term here\].

Those without technical knowledge can often mistake decibels for competence. Bullies can appear to know what they are talking about. The business has no way to know and will often start placing their trust in those bullies. Because they appear to be experts and/or get the job done. 

It is of course also possible that bullies are truly experts in their field and do know best. But even then is 'winning' an argument by force not a good idea. It negatively impacts so much more then just the bully peers. This is not to say that if one truly does know 'best', you are not allowed to advocate your point. As a professional it is your responsibility to give the customer the greatest value for their money. So one should definitely speak up.

>A point should be made on sound arguments. Not on insults or decibels.

**Bullies and Dungeon masters**

A while back Alberto Brandolini identified a pattern he called the [Dungeon master](https://medium.com/@ziobrando/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-dungeon-master-c2d511eed12f)[^dungeon]. Now the Dungeon master is a position everyone of us might find himself in if we stay somewhere long enough. It is not a position of malevolence. 
 
> The dark secret of the Dungeon Master is that he knows every trap in the existing legacy software, because he was the one to leave the traps around. This isnâ€™t intentional or evil. Knowledge, in the form of accidental complexity starts accumulating in the head of the Dungeon Master, and silently grows.

The additional danger of a dungeon master is that when dungeon masters couples their ego to their 'dungeon' they will become a force that resist change and improvement. If they have gained a legendary hero status as well they can become a major obstacle in the never ending road to improvement. Because they will become a bully for anyone that criticizes the existing system. Their baby. Since they have all the knowledge, a hero status and possibly some minions they can easily block any new idea's. Changed that must be made, bottlenecks that must be fix, software that needs to be replaced... all of these initiatives can be block by a bully dungeon master.

While a dungeon master in itself is not an evil force, a bully is. A dungeon master can become a bully. But a bully that goes unobstructed long enough will inevitably become a dungeon master. Giving them that much more power. Because now they are the only ones that know all the traps and pitfalls. Making it almost impossible to go against them.
  

**Conclusion**

What appear to be heroes to you may very well be **bullies** to others. Beware that you aren't left with self-aggrandizing loudmouths while the competent constructive professionals that wanted the best for the company have left without you even noticing. Make sure you hear more then one side of the story.

[^dungeon]: In Alberto's [Dungeon master](https://medium.com/@ziobrando/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-dungeon-master-c2d511eed12f) post he introduces the pattern of the dungeon master. And even mentions the minions. Which could possibly correlate to my definition of minions.
