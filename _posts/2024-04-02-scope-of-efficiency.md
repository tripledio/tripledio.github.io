## The scope off efficiency

One also must take into account that efficiency occurs within a specific context or scope. Individual components, processes or "resources" may be efficient on their own, but if they do not work together well, there will be waste on the whole. In other words, efficiency is not just about optimizing individual tasks or elements; it's about ensuring that **all** parts of a system function harmoniously together.

Luckily for us there is quit a lot of study done on the efficiency within systems in relation to their individual components and their interactions with the larger system. The domain of systems thinking focus on understanding complex systems as a whole, including how their various components interact and influence overall performance.  Systems thinking emphasizes the interconnectedness of components within a system and examines how changes to one part can affect the system as a whole. 

Below a couple of quotes that are relevant for our discussion 

+ "Local optimization creates global suboptimization." - John Seddon
+ "Optimizing a part of the system will not necessarily optimize the whole." - W. Edwards Deming
+ "The performance of a system is not the sum of the performances of its parts taken separately, but the product of their interactions." - Russell Ackoff
+ "Any improvements made anywhere besides the bottleneck are an illusion." - Gene Kim

So when someone complains about an efficiency, make sure that they clarify the scope of the (in)efficiency. It is very easy to lose sight of the system as a whole. Something that is often at the root of those four costly words. We will come back to this when focussing on software engineering practices.

## Delivering Projects

A possible case where efficiency is more important than resiliency could be when delivering a short term software project as an external party. Because there is no need to be resilient, share knowledge in short term project mode. Commit to the deadline, deliver within the promissed time and budget and onwards to the next project!

When the environment is well controlled, the time span short enough to hopefully avoid unexpected changes, the requirements small and limited enough so that the estimates are in the realm of reality then this can work. You can work efficiently, getting the most revenue from your consultant work by maximizing your consultant utilization, using the best expert for the job and doing it right immediately.

However, that are a lot of ifs. And then we haven't taken into account what happens to the software once the project is done. Who will maintain it? What is the quality of the software delivery under the pressure of being efficient and doing it withing the fixed time and budget?
