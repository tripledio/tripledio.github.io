# DevOps: Continous Delivery

## History
I'm a *developer*, and have often been in a situation where I had to work with the classical form of an *operations department* which basically boils down to:

1. Write code for [3-36] months;
2. Plan meeting with ops;
3. Throw some artifact over the mythical wall separating the men from the boys (either side presumes they are the men);
4. Wait until the first failure and start finger-pointing at each other.

While this has led to many success scenario's, I have had some better experiences with "DevOps". Unfortunately DevOps has gone down the same path as Agile. The original intent might have been completely lost during another buzzword bingo meeting. So lets start from the beginning.

## Continuous Integration
Has been around for a bit longer, and is generally accepted amongst most developers. This means that code from John and from Dave meet in whatever source code repository that you're using *as fast as possible*. Then it should get picked up by a build server so that there is valuable feedback about the integration: compilation, test reports, etc.

### Details
Branching strategy, or even trunk based development. Both can work, but it all depends on your team.

#### Feature branching works when:
* Features don't stay open longer than needed, developers drive integration, kanban helps here (limit your work in progress);
* Changes from the integration branch are distributed on each open branch quickly.

#### Trunk based development works when:
* Developers are good enough to do small increments;
* Architecture allows this;
* Code reviews are pre-commit (pairing);
* You don't have people withholding work on their local machine for days or even weeks because it's not done yet.

All-in-all, these days, with most teams, I'd go for feature branching. It gives you more strategies to play with.

## Continuous Delivery
This is where software developers usually fall short. We integrate code as quickly as possible and then it just sits there, gathering dust while developers add more features. I sometimes make the following comparison: what if Amazon only shipped once a quarter, what would their warehouse look like. We should probably try not to keep everything in the warehouse until Christmas. But instead get things out there, to customers, as soon as possible. They already payed for their goods and are waiting for it! The same applies to our code, they already payed for it so getting it to them as soon as possible feels like the right thing to do.

#### But wait, I have *environments*
Sure, production is one of them, everybody has that one. Then depending on the terminology you have UAT, ITT, DEV, etc. We usually have them set up, because they were set up manually. However, as soon as you've automated the creation of your environments they can be created and destroyed as needed. You can even have one per feature branch. It can be validated by your product owner. As soon as the feature is approved, the branch gets merged and with it the environment disappears. Your environment will turn into your *shortest possible* feedback cycle.

Usually environments are coupled with a set of data. Sometimes it's data that got copied once from production for load and/or performance testing. This is another automatable task. It's a separate responsibility to be able to export/import data from/to any environment which sounds an awful lot like a possible backup strategy as well.

### Mindset of *complete automation*
What all continuous delivery pipelines have in common is that people are no longer required to get something up and running. You write code and sit-back until it's up&running somewhere. The trick here is mindset. Any task that a person in your team has to perform should be automated. The scripts should be versioned inside a version control system, just like code.

This also prevents other problems, specific information that resides with only one developer is now available in a git repo, just like code. This opens up any task to the same process you might have in place for code quality, like code-reviews.

## Recap
So, CD is not possible without CI. It's the next step. There are plenty of technologies that can be used. Any deployment platform should have an automated option, even if it's remotely ssh'ing and executing the commands from a script under source control. Since people hire us to solve their problems in an efficient automated manner, these techniques should be applied to our own job.

As a result of this automation it could mean that you can go to production, or create/update multiple *environments* 4 times a day instead of 4 times a year.

### Is this DevOps?
It's part of it. But it's a lot more, the *you build it, you ship it* means that you also manage more aspects: monitoring, tracing, log management, failure management, circuit breakers, backups, etc. But I would prefer to start from a CD pipeline, since that would be a foundation for rolling out all these aspects. Your infrastructure, formally described declaratively.

My hope is that in a couple of years all apps will be available instantly, that adding infrastructure is a matter of adding some container in a compose file. That would free up time and allow developers to focus more on writing quality code rather then sitting in meeting rooms talking about all the manual steps needed to deploy our applications.

I'd like to remind people about what was said about manual testing. For me this is equally true for any manual task during software development.

>Manual testing is immoral. Not only is it highly stressing, tedious, and error prone; itâ€™s just wrong to turn humans into machines. If you can write a script for a test procedure, then you can write a program to execute that procedure. That program will be cheaper, faster, and more accurate than a human, and will free the human to do what humans to best: create!
