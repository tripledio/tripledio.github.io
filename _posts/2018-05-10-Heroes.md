# Wild west heroes

In this post I would like to discuss a human trait and it's impact on software development. The trait to place certain people on a pedestal. Wether it is ourselves or others. People love heroes. A hero is a type of developer that is often well respected and revered by his peers. And one that can be well known by  management. In this post I will analyze a couple the different categories of heroic behaviour I ve encountered and discuss their impact on the hero, their peers, the customer and the software.
 
Now over the years I have encountered developer heroics in almost every company I worked at. In a variety of different forms. Heroes are often known by management for getting things to work fast in the face of a looming deadline. Or they are the ones the company constantly relies on for saving the day when the shit hits the fan in production. These developers throw themselves in the midst of "battle" time and time again. Saving the day. To their fellow software developers they often have the reputation of being very 'smart', for being true experts.[^hero] Oh, what would we do without them?

## Wild west

In the case of hero developers I often think of them as the cowboy gunslingers from the wild west. You know, the classic cowboys that draw fast and shoot straight. Who ride in to town, save the day in an epic gun fight. And then ride of in the sunset. As a kid, who did not aspire to be such a hero? 

The residents of the town in the wild west are happy when they are saved by this hero. The danger has been averted, evil doers slain. Oh happy days! The gunslinger is loved and admired. Perhaps even worshipped. After a while there can even form a little group centered around the hero gunslinger. The hero that everyone relies on and tries to imitate. Whom is loved by all... 

### Types of heroes

Now of course there are all kinds of different heroes, cowboys and gunslingers roaming the wild west. Using my wild west metaphor I have made a humble attempt to note down the different types of heroes that I myself have encountered over the years. Once I started this trip through memory lane it got a bit out of hand. So i ended up splitting this post into different parts. This post is the general overview and for each "pattern" I made a separate page. 

*TODO: Als je betere namen hebt voor mijn hero typetjes, shoot*

#### The young buck

This type of 'hero' is for me typically the young naive buck. The young gunslinger full of high ideals, with a simplistic sense of justice, who is doing all the fighting and taking all the risks. But often gets played for a fool and lets someone else reaps the benefit. He might even get scorned and chased away by the very people he was fighting for. 

The mainly see themselves as a hero, if they are lucky they are also appreciated by the people they are helping. But they don't realise that they are often just used for canon fodder and for doing the dirty work.

#### The lone ranger

Another type of hero is a person who is more of loner. They get the job done by themselves, work alone. Always there to save the day that needs constant saving.

Some take pride in their lone ranger actions, bot others would very much like to put an end to the necessity of it and live a quiet happy life. But circumstances won't let them.

#### The posse 

The posse is a rowdy bunch that has taken justice in their own hands. They have thrown themselves in the midst of things. They are loyal to each other and stick together. But they can lose track of the purpose of their actions. constantly in the midst of things they have no time to think how they can prevent future troubles.

Just like lone rangers, some posses take pride in their heroics actions. Others are doing it because they don't see an alternative. Depending on how long a posse runs they can be viewed initially as heroes but run the risk that over time people start seeing them as a necessary evil that they much rather get rid of.

#### Local heroes

The fastest gunslingers are often the hero of the pack. Their actions have given them a reputation as saviors, those you can rely on, the ones who know best. Their reputations have risen to legendary. Tales of their heroic exploits have bolstered their reputation far outside the realm of their immediate environment.

The gunslingers are mostly placed on a pedestal by their peers. Sometimes they or even worshipped by some. They are the ones people turn to and place their trust in. All too often this is also linked their ego. Because who doesn't like to be loved, to be the 'leader', to be seen as infallible?

#### The bully 

The bully often goes hand in hand with the local hero. Depending if you oppose/disagree with them, heroes can become bullies, ruling by brute force and by the political weight that was given to them. After all who would dare to go against the will of the hero of the people.

> A hero to some, a bully to others

While often feared instead of loved by his peers, the terrorizing gunslinger still appears a hero to the people of the town. Their heroes still get the job done and the townspeople care about the results. They don't need to collaborate with gunslinger themselves. So the bullies remain 'in power' by the approval of the townspeople in the one hand, and by intimidating and belitteling any potential contenders.

### The problems with gunslingers

The townspeople are sure lucky to have heroes around willing to save them and maintain law and order. However what the residents of the town really need is for the wild west to be tamed. In the wild west they need to rely on the heroes but they would much prefer it if the heroes were no longer necessary. That they can continue to steadily work, expand, grow their city. Go about their business and improve their lives. 

The townspeople need to rely on the law enforcers to keep the town safe. Where some of the law enforcers are regarded as heroes, other can be viewed as a necessary evil.  Where the townspeople hope for a safe environment, they often need to rely on hero gunslingers to quell any outlaw uprising. All the while they desire a future where violent episodes never occur again, where they can reliably predict the future without needing to live in constant fear. But often they do not know that there is another way..
 
 What they really need is a _professional_ reliable law enforcement. One that nips all trouble in the but, well before it occurs. From whom the people don't even know that they are there. The townspeople can just safely work in their software. Excuse me, town.

## Hero software engineers

I have chosen the wild west metaphor because the software industry has some resemblance to its wild nature. We are still a young industry that is frequently revolutionized by the next "new" thing. We are still moving frontiers. Us, the tech savy experts, feel safe there but for others it can be a scary place. They need to rely on us and pray that we know what we are doing. While software developers seldom hold quick drawing contests to show who's boss, at least not to my knowledge, they have their own ways of trying to dominate each other.

In my little wild west comparison the residents of the town are of course the customers, the town is the software, the enforcers of the law are the software developers. Software developers need to work together, which brings the social aspect into play (shock!). Often engineers also want to show off their competence and shine. Even if it is just to prove to themselves how great they are. Recently [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo) made a relevant [tweet](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/991421712989208576) about the heroic drive in software development.

>"Comes in the middle of the night, cleans things up, you only know they were there because everything is organized and tidy." -- Sarah Drasner

Now heroics can manifest themselves in many different forms. In the more detailed blog posts of the patterns I have tried to elaborate on how I see the different types of heroes appear in the software industry. The young buck, lone ranger and the posse are in the heroic realm by their actions in production, making deadlines, fixing things. The local hero and the bullies are heroes by reputation. The latter two have more of a social aspect to them and thus they have a larger impact on their environment.

## Conclusion

Since software development involves a lot of humans working together it is normal that peoples behavior has an impact on the quality, return on investment and usefulness of software. The reason I wrote down these musings of mine on 'heroic' behavior I've encountered over the years is because at first glance it looks like things are going well. Everything is under control, we have very highly competent people on the job. Until you look more closely an observe how things are really transpiring.

When you think everything is going well, make sure that the reason we think that is because of professionalism. Not because of heroics.

He defined heroes as [taking initiative](https://twitter.com/jamesmarcusbach/status/992003069763244032). That is not what I am talking about. I'm talking heroes as being revered.
