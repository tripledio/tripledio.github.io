# Heroes


In this post I would like to talk about a certain type of developer a lot of us probably aspire to be at one point in our career. A type of developer that is often well respected and revered by his peers. And one that is well known by whatever management there is in place. For this post i will label them the **hero** developers. 

Now these heroes don't necessarily have to be experts or very competent. They can be and often are. But it is more about how they view themselves, how they are viewed by their peers, customers or management that makes them a "hero" in someones eyes. It is not their importance or their expertise that I would like to discuss. But the impact of heroics on themselves, their environment and the software that is being developped, maintained.

This is clearly another definition for heroes then James marcus bach had in his article[^hero]. He defined heroes as [taking initiative](https://twitter.com/jamesmarcusbach/status/992003069763244032). That is not what I am talking about.
 
Over the years I have encountered developer heroics in almost every company I worked at. These heroes are often known by management for getting things to work fast in the face of a looming deadline. Or they are the ones the company constantly relies on for saving the day when the shit hits the fan in production. These developers throw themselves in the midst of "battle" time and time again. Saving the day. To their fellow software developers they often have the reputation of being very 'smart', for being true experts. 

Oh, what would we do without them?

## Wild west


In the case of hero developers I often think of them as the cowboy gunslingers from the wild west. You know, the classic cowboys that draw fast and shoot straight. Who ride in to town, save the day in an epic gun fight. And then ride of in the sunset. As a kid, who did not aspire to be such a hero? 

The residents of the town in the wild west are happy when they are saved by this hero. The danger has been averted, evil doers slain. Oh happy days! The gunslinger is loved and admired. Perhaps even worshipped. After a while there can even form a little group centered around the hero gunslinger. The hero that everyone relies on and tries to imitate. Whom is loved by all...

Now of course there are all kinds of different heroes, cowboys and gunslingers raoming the wild west. Using my wild west metaphor I have made a humble attempt to note down the different types of heroes that I myself have encountered over the years.  

### The young buck

This type of 'hero' is for me typically the young naive buck. The young gunslinger full of high ideals, with a simplistic sense of justice, who is doing all the fighting and taking all the risks. But often gets played for a fool and lets someone else reaps the benefit. He might even get scorned and chased away by the very people he was fighting for. 

The mainly see themselves as a hero, if they are lucky they are also appreciated by the people they are helping. But they don't realise that they are often just used for canon fodder and for doing the dirty work. 

### The lone ranger

Another type of hero is a person who is more of loner. They get the job done by themselves, work alone. Always there to save the day that needs constant saving.

Some take pride in their lone ranger actions, bot others would very much like to put an end to the necessity of it and live a quiet happy life. But circumstances won't let them.

### The posse 

The posse is a rowdy bunch that has taken justice in their own hands. They have thrown themselves in the midst of things. They are loyal to each other and stick together. But they can lose track of the purpose of their actions. constantly in the midst of things they have no time to think how they can prevent future troubles.

Just like lone rangers, some posses take pride in their heroics actions. Others are doing it because they don't see an alternative. Depending on how long a posse runs they can be viewed initially as heroes but run the risk that over time people start seeing them as a necessary evil that they much rather get rid of.

### The hero gunslinger

The fastest gunslingers are often the hero of the pack. Their skills have given them a reputation as saviors, the ones who know best. Tales of their heroic exploits have bolstered their reputation, allwoing them to get away with things the common folks wouldn't.

The gunslingers are mostly placed on a pedestal by their peers. Sometimes they or even worshipped by some. They are the ones people turn to and place their trust in. All too often this is also linked their ego. Because who doesn't like to be loved, to be the 'leader'. 

### The terrorizing gunslinger

This type of 'hero' you get when you get a dictator instead of a leader. It often goes hand in hand with the hero gunslinger. Depending if you oppose them, heroes can become dictators ruling by brute force and by the political weight that was given to them. Who would dare to go against the will of the hero of the people.

Often feared instead of loved by his peers the terrorizing gunslinger still appears a hero to the people of the town. Their heroes still get the job done and the townspeople care about the results. They don't need to work with gunslinger themselves.

### The problems with heroes

The townspeople are sure luky to have heroes around willing to save them and maintain law and order. However what the residents of the town really need is for the wild west to be tamed. In the wild west they need to rely on the heroes but they would much prefer it if the heroes were no longer necessary. So that they can continue to steadily work, expand, grow their city. Go about their business and improve their lives. 

They desire a future where violent episodes never occur again and they can reliably predict the future without needing to live in constant fear.  What they really need, even if they sometimes don't realize it themselves, is a _professional_ reliable law enforcement. One that nips all trouble in the but, well before it occurs. From whom you don't even know that they are there. They can just safely work in their software. Excuse me, town.

I have chosen the wild west metaphor because the software industry is still such a young industry that is frequently revolutionized by the next new thing. We are still moving frontiers. Us the tech savy experts feel safe there but for others it can be a scary place. In my little wild west comparison the residents of the town are of course the customers, the town is the software, the enforcers of the law are the software developers. The townspeople need to rely on the law enforcers to keep the town safe. Where some of the law enforcers are regarded as heroes, other can be viewed as a necessary evil.  Where the townspeople hope for a safe environment, they often need to rely on hero gunslingers to quell any outlaw uprising. Often they do not know that there is another way..
