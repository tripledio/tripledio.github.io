# Wild west heroes

In this post I would like to talk a certain types of software developer a lot of us probably aspire to be at one point in our career. A type of developer that is often well respected and revered by his peers. And one that is well known by whatever management there is in place. They are often considerd **heroes**  by themselves or others. So in this post I will analyze all the different categories of heroic behaviour I ve encountered so far. 

Over the years I have encountered developer heroics in almost every company I worked at. These heroes are often known by management for getting things to work fast in the face of a looming deadline. Or they are the ones the company constantly relies on for saving the day when the shit hits the fan in production. These developers throw themselves in the midst of "battle" time and time again. Saving the day. To their fellow software developers they often have the reputation of being very 'smart', for being true experts.[^hero] 

Oh, what would we do without them?

## Wild west


In the case of hero developers I often think of them as the cowboy gunslingers from the wild west. You know, the classic cowboys that draw fast and shoot straight. Who ride in to town, save the day in an epic gun fight. And then ride of in the sunset. As a kid, who did not aspire to be such a hero? 

The residents of the town in the wild west are happy when they are saved by this hero. The danger has been averted, evil doers slain. Oh happy days! The gunslinger is loved and admired. Perhaps even worshipped. After a while there can even form a little group centered around the hero gunslinger. The hero that everyone relies on and tries to imitate. Whom is loved by all... 

### Types of heroes

Now of course there are all kinds of different heroes, cowboys and gunslingers roaming the wild west. Using my wild west metaphor I have made a humble attempt to note down the different types of heroes that I myself have encountered over the years.  

*TODO: Als je betere namen hebt voor mijn hero typpetjes, shoot*

#### The young buck

This type of 'hero' is for me typically the young naive buck. The young gunslinger full of high ideals, with a simplistic sense of justice, who is doing all the fighting and taking all the risks. But often gets played for a fool and lets someone else reaps the benefit. He might even get scorned and chased away by the very people he was fighting for. 

The mainly see themselves as a hero, if they are lucky they are also appreciated by the people they are helping. But they don't realise that they are often just used for canon fodder and for doing the dirty work. 

#### The lone ranger

Another type of hero is a person who is more of loner. They get the job done by themselves, work alone. Always there to save the day that needs constant saving.

Some take pride in their lone ranger actions, bot others would very much like to put an end to the necessity of it and live a quiet happy life. But circumstances won't let them.

#### The posse 

The posse is a rowdy bunch that has taken justice in their own hands. They have thrown themselves in the midst of things. They are loyal to each other and stick together. But they can lose track of the purpose of their actions. constantly in the midst of things they have no time to think how they can prevent future troubles.

Just like lone rangers, some posses take pride in their heroics actions. Others are doing it because they don't see an alternative. Depending on how long a posse runs they can be viewed initially as heroes but run the risk that over time people start seeing them as a necessary evil that they much rather get rid of.

#### Legendary heroes

The fastest gunslingers are often the hero of the pack. Their actions have given them a reputation as saviors, those you can rely on, the ones who know best. Their reputations have risen to legendary. Tales of their heroic exploits have bolstered their reputation far outside the realm of their immediate environment.

The gunslingers are mostly placed on a pedestal by their peers. Sometimes they or even worshipped by some. They are the ones people turn to and place their trust in. All too often this is also linked their ego. Because who doesn't like to be loved, to be the 'leader', to be seen as infallible? 

#### The bully 

The bully often goes hand in hand with the legendary gunslinger. Depending if you oppose/disagree with them, heroes can become bullies, ruling by brute force and by the political weight that was given to them. After all who would dare to go against the will of the hero of the people.

> A hero to some, a bully to others

While often feared instead of loved by his peers, the terrorizing gunslinger still appears a hero to the people of the town. Their heroes still get the job done and the townspeople care about the results. They don't need to collaborate with gunslinger themselves. So the bullies remain 'in power' by the approval of the townspeople in the one hand, and by intimidating and belitteling any potential contenders.

![gun](/img/posts/heroes/gun.jpg)

### The problems with gunslingers

The townspeople are sure lucky to have heroes around willing to save them and maintain law and order. However what the residents of the town really need is for the wild west to be tamed. In the wild west they need to rely on the heroes but they would much prefer it if the heroes were no longer necessary. That they can continue to steadily work, expand, grow their city. Go about their business and improve their lives. 

The townspeople need to rely on the law enforcers to keep the town safe. Where some of the law enforcers are regarded as heroes, other can be viewed as a necessary evil.  Where the townspeople hope for a safe environment, they often need to rely on hero gunslingers to quell any outlaw uprising. All the while they desire a future where violent episodes never occur again, where they can reliably predict the future without needing to live in constant fear. But often they do not know that there is another way..
 
 What they really need is a _professional_ reliable law enforcement. One that nips all trouble in the but, well before it occurs. From whom the people don't even know that they are there. The townspeople can just safely work in their software. Excuse me, town.

## Hero software engineers

I have chosen the wild west metaphor because the software industry has some resemblance to its wild nature. We are still a young industry that is frequently revolutionized by the next "new" thing. We are still moving frontiers. Us, the tech savy experts, feel safe there but for others it can be a scary place. They need to rely on us and pray that we know what we are doing. While software developers seldom hold quick drawing contests to show who's boss, at least not to my knowledge, they have their own ways of trying to dominate each other.

In my little wild west comparison the residents of the town are of course the customers, the town is the software, the enforcers of the law are the software developers.

Now let me elaborate on how I see the different types of heroes appear in the software industry. The young buck, lone ranger and the posse are in the heroic realm by their actions in production, making deadlines, fixing things. The legendary hero and the bullies are heroes by reputation. There is more a social aspect to them and thus they have a larger impact on their environment.

### The young buck

__considered heroes by themselves, "work hard", deadlines, low quality software__

In the software world I have seen these 'young buck' hero typically in a consulting context. The young developers, with little experience, starting with a consultancy firm. They are the ones te most easy to convince that they need to put in the time, work hard, pull late nighters, work in the weekends, to make that big deadline. Often of some fixed-prize waterfall project that was bound to fail from the start. Yes, people still do big waterfall projects. Remember Obama care? [^obama-cio]

The developers that are doing this hard work, rushing from deadline to deadline, often do this from a misplaced sense of pride. Perhaps even a sense of professionalism. Look at us working hard, getting things done. Our company and customer will be so proud... 

It is precisely that sense of taking pride in doing 'heroic' deeds that categorizes them for me as the young buck. I've certainly seen older consultants do yet another project with crazy arbitrary deadlines. But usually they have long lost the pride part and are doing it because it pays the bills or advances their career with the boss. They do it consciously.
    
The young buck hero was for me what Sandro Mancuso discussed in a very recognizable way in chapter 5 of his book [The Software Craftsman](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Craftsman-Professionalism-Pragmatism-Robert/dp/0134052501/) [^sandroBook]. Being a hero may make you feel good about yourself, that you are saving the day, making crazy deadlines, doing a lot of overtime... 

Often the only one who benefits form these heroics is the young bucks boss. Who get's paid by the customer for the work and overtime. Of course often a bone will be thrown towards the ones doing the actual work. But it isn't the boss that is sitting there in the weekends, pulling an all nighter...

Even if the deadline is met the customer is often left with very poorly written software which a high maintenance cost. Did I mention Obama care[^obama-cbs]? I could of course mention a lot of belgian projects as well. The young bucks may feel like heroes while they are rushing for the deadline, doing quick fixes, patch job after path job in production but in the long run it is the software that suffers and the customer that will overpay for a low quality product. Because it is more important _how_ a job was done, than that the job was done. Because as we all know, software always changes, and is never 'done'. And that is a good thing. There should be life _possible_ after a deadline.[^constructionTale] 

To those young bucks out there let me make it clear that working hard no matter what does not make you a professional. Not even if you 'make' the deadline by working 16hours a day. 

> Heroics shouldn't come into play, heroes should not be necessary, the day should not _need_ saving. 

While it may be a heroic thing to do, it would have been better if it never was necessary. That the job was just predictable steadiness, without any heroic battles... 
     
Of course sometimes things can still go wrong in production. An urgent intervention can be needed. But this should really be an exceptional case. And when it does happen, it should be dealt with swiftly. With a thorough post morten so that we learn how to avoid this in the future, making sure _it does not happen again_. Because we don't want to let the exceptional become the normal.
    
### The lone ranger

__considered heroes by customers, production issues, single point of failure__

The lone rangers are the software engineers who are always on call, always there when the shits hit the fan. They are the lone ranger that always saves the day. But no one really knows what is going on. This is a type of 'hero' that I have come across on several occasions as well. Almost always the case the hero was barely keeping everything a float, trying to catch a break, keeping up the illusion that everything is under control, hoping to eventually get their life back. Often no one really knows how bad the situation is because there is only one who knows what is really going on.

> Due to a lack of knowledge, discipline, or ability to say no, things have gotten out of control. 

The lone ranger often runs the risk for a burnout. Which is especially dangerous since they can't be missed. They are often revered by the customer, since they are the ones saving the day. But that is a sentiment that often passes over time as the customer gets tired of the never ending problems.

> If you need constant saving by heroes, you might consider hiring some professionals

Of course sometimes things can still go wrong in production. An urgent intervention can be needed. But this should really be an exceptional case. And when it does happen, it should be dealt with swiftly. With a thorough post morten so that we learn how to avoid this in the future, making sure _it does not happen again_. Because we don't want to let the exceptional become the normal.

### The posse 

__considered heroes by themselves, critical saves in production, team bonding, outsiders don't really know what is going on__

The posse is essentially the same this as the lone ranger but now it occurs in a team context. When you have a team that is constantly 'fixing' things. Things that no one else knows about. When most of the teams time is spent on operational problems, then there is a serious problem. A problem that should be addressed asap. before it makes the evening news...
 
If the posse team consists out of the same people that developed the systems in the first place then the problem is even bigger. Because then you are effectively paying  the outlaws to maintain the order in town... 

This pattern is actually quite dangerous. Because the impact of an entire team on software is larger than that of an individual. A posse ofte will probably also stick together so it is not easy to make changes gradually. 
   

### Legends 

__considered heroic by peers/customer , expert/guru , cult, stiffle growth, political__

Legends are those software developers that carry a lot of weight with their peers, as well as with management. Through whatever actions they did in the past they have earned a reputation and are considered to be very valuable, almost indispensable. 

When people constantly rely on someone, give much weight to their opinions, delegate their judgement to them, basically placing them onto a pedestal then this runs the risk that the object of their 'worship' lose objectivity themselves. Even when the heroes have the best of intentions, and not all heroes necessarily do, it is hard to not get too full of yourselves when everyone considers you exceptional. That's why I deem these 'legendary' heroes dangerous because they often come with a huge ego. 

**Ego**

A little mental check that I do for this is keeping track if I ever heard someone admitting that they where wrong or saw them change their minds by someones else argument. When someone can never admit a mistake I try to avoid getting into an argument with them altogether. Personally I start placing little value on their opinion or 'arguments'. Because they aren't being honest.

> They are not trying to help, they are trying to win...

Of course it is normal that people argue and defend their points of view. To a certain point. We all have this to some degree. But if someone is truly incapable of decoupling their ego from their solution then it is impossible to have a meaningful conversation. Because their ego does not permit them to admit that they are not omniscient. So there is really no point in debating them. You are just waisting time and money.

Unfortunately depending on their hero status in a group, getting involved with them may be unavoidable. If the legendary hero has a loyal following, then that can produce even an organizational risk and you'll need to deal with their minions as well.

**Cripples growth**

Even when someone is capable of keeping their ego in check, being 'worshipped' is still not a good thing. Even if perhaps somewhere deep down we all would like it. At the one hand worship runs the risk of stifling the heroes own growth because they are not being properly challenged. The heroes can get lazily in their thinking, get to used to 'being right'. The ego gets inflated, loosing touch with reality. And no matter how good they are, they become less valuable...

**No ownership**

For the team heroes aren't without risk as well. The danger is that the team gets lazy, that they stifle their own growth. Because after a while the hero is no longer questioned. Just follow the leader of the pack, be safe, take it easy. 

When there are heroes around, people often don't take ownership themselves. They feel secure in the presence of heroes. Or intimidated. They run the risk of becoming complacent, just following along, not challenging the leader but also not challenging themselves. No responsibility needs to be taken. People run the risk of not living up to their own full potential. This way, heroes often block the team members from using the full potential. Which is not only a waste but also dangerous.
     
Decisions can get postponed until they get approval by a hero. Because people don't want to make the decision, take the responsibility themselves. Or run the risk that a decision taken when the hero was absent will be immediately overturned when the hero returns. This not only starts resembling a dictatorship but it turns the hero into a bottleneck. 
     
This passive behaviour is very dangerous for the software and the company. Because we are all humans.
     
> No one can know everything, think of everything or is infallible. 
  
Even if you should have found some of those infallible IT-heroes, even they can not be everywhere at the same time. The team needs to ready and competent to handle everything without the heroes being around.  

That is why we need everyone to pitch in, using all the brain power available. Even when there are people that are more knowledgable, experienced or 'smarter' then you, allow yourself the grow and don't remain in the hero shadow. 

>It is ok that people seek guidance or mentoring. It is not ok if they stop thinking for themselves.

**Minions**

Dominating heroes also can complicate the political landscape. It can happen that a little cult of followers starts forming around one person. Apart from the ownership issues, this is also a dangerous thing politically. It adds the additional complexity that next to the existing organizational silo's often present in a organisation, there is an additional group that can possibly run across organizational boundaries and strive for their own political aims. In this case the leader of the hero cult may gain more power than the organization/ customer is willing to consciously give to them. 

The group of minions also can lead to a certain tribalism, a certain group pressure. Us vs them. Where they can gang up on someone outside of the group, under the protection of the leader. This can lead to competent people leaving the firm because they aren't willing to play petty politics and are unable to do a proper job. Again, the customer loses.

**Lead**

The danger of the legendary heroes lies not so much with the heroes themselves. But more with the impact they have on their peers. Or rather the impact their peers **allow** them to have. The heroes need to take care that they don't become bullies, that they keep their ego in check. [^jocko] But they aren't responsible for any passive, worshipping attitude that their peers may have. It is a good thing that software engineers have the confidence  of the business. But this should be the  logical consequence of the team doing a consistent good job. Heroics shouldn't be necessary. 


### The bully
__considered heroic by peers/customer , expert/guru, dungeon master , stiffle growth, unsafe environment__

This type of 'hero' you get when you get someone that uses their power to bully those that do not follow suit. If one is lauded as the hero that saved the day often enough, then it is possible to assume that you're always right and others simply need to follow suit.

Like I said before software developers don't hold quick drawing contests but they have their own ways of trying to show who's boss. Typically this is done by demonstrating superior knowledge on some technical field. A framework, language, technology... Even if one doesn't really have deep knowledge, make a lot of noise , spouting some buzz words and professing that the opposing party is a \[insert derogatory term here\].

Those without technical knowledge can often mistake decibels for competence. Bullies can appear to know what they are talking about. The business has no way to know and will often start placing their trust in those bullies. Because they appear to be experts and/or get the job done. 

It is of course also possible that bullies are truly experts in their field and do know best. But even then is 'winning' an argument by force not a good idea. It negatively impacts so much more then just the bully peers. This is not to say that if one truly does know 'best', you are not allowed to advocate your point. As a professional it is your responsibility to give the customer the greatest value for their money. So one should definitely speak up.

>A point should be made on sound arguments. Not on insults or decibels.

**Bullies and Dungeon masters**

A while back Alberto Brandolini identified a pattern he called the [Dungeon master](https://medium.com/@ziobrando/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-dungeon-master-c2d511eed12f)[^dungeon]. Now the Dungeon master is a position everyone of us might find himself in if we stay somewhere long enough. It is not a position of malevolence. 
 
> The dark secret of the Dungeon Master is that he knows every trap in the existing legacy software, because he was the one to leave the traps around. This isn’t intentional or evil. Knowledge, in the form of accidental complexity starts accumulating in the head of the Dungeon Master, and silently grows.

The additional danger of a dungeon master is that when dungeon masters couples their ego to their 'dungeon' they will become a force that resist change and improvement. If they have gained a legendary hero status as well they can become a major obstacle in the never ending road to improvement. Because they will become a bully for anyone that criticizes the existing system. Their baby. Since they have all the knowledge, a hero status and possibly some minions they can easily block any new idea's. Changed that must be made, bottlenecks that must be fix, software that needs to be replaced... all of these initiatives can be block by a bully dungeon master.

While a dungeon master in itself is not an evil force, a bully is. A dungeon master can become a bully. But a bully that goes unobstructed long enough will inevitably become a dungeon master. Giving them that much more power. Because now they are the only ones that know all the traps and pitfalls. Making it almost impossible to go against them.
  

## Be Humble

A classic tip that is useful everywhere in life. Seriously. Everyone wants to be special. But no one knows everything and everyone makes mistakes. Remember this little tweet:

> The smartest people I know:
>
> 1. Admit they know very little
> 2. Constantly seek more info
> 3. Encourage intellectual debate
> 4. Have strong opinions, loosely held
> 5. Are comfortable being wrong
> 6. Surrounded by best people
> 7. Realize life isn't black & white
> 8. Fear bias & arrogance

 As software developers we often tend to couple or ego to our knowledge and intelligence. Constantly learning and improving yourself is definitely an admirable trait. Just don't turn into a bully. When I am looking for people to work with I am looking to their mentality first. No matter how competent or genius you are, the 'mission' comes first. We are all smart people. But can we work together?

## Conclusion

Since software development involves a lot of humans working together it is normal that peoples behavior has an impact on the quality, return on investment and usefulness of software. The reason I wrote down these musings of mine on 'heroic' behavior I've encountered over the years is because at first glance it looks like things are going well. Everything is under control, we have very highly competent people on the job. Until you look more closely an observe how things are really transpiring.

+ The **young bucks** may feel like they are doing the right thing. Working hard, making deadlines, saving the day. But seeing from some distance they are creating a mess, rushing from deadline to deadline. Delivering low quality and potentially causing a lot of damage.
+ The **lone ranger** and **posse** may look like they have everything under control. But things are brewing beneath the surface. And it will inevitably explode. If this is not on our radar we very well make the evening news on some idle thursday. Beware! Make sure we know what is going one. Exceptional interventions should be very exceptional. Chaos should not be the norm!
+ **Legendary** heroes may seem comforting, because everyone speaks so highly of them. But make sure that the even the legends can take a vacation of change jobs. No one sticks around for ever. Everyone must do their part.
+ What appear to be heroes to you may very well be **bullies** to others. Beware that you aren't left with self-aggrandizing loudmouths while the competent constructive professionals that wanted the best for the company have left without you even noticing. Make sure you hear more then one side of the story. 

When you think everything is going well, make sure that the reason we think that is because of professionalism. Not because of heroics.
