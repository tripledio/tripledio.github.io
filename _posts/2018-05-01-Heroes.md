# Heroes


In this post I would like to talk about a certain type of developer a lot of us probably aspire to be at one point in our career. A type of developer that is often well respected and revered by his peers. And one that is well known by whatever management there is in place. For this post i will label them the **hero** developers. 

Now these heroes don't necessarily have to be experts or very competent. They can be and often are. But it is more about how they view themselves, how they are viewed by their peers, customers or management that makes them a "hero" in someones eyes. It is not their importance or their expertise that I would like to discuss. But the impact of heroics on themselves, their environment and the software that is being developped, maintained.

This is clearly another definition for heroes then James marcus bach had in his article[^hero]. He defined heroes as [taking initiative](https://twitter.com/jamesmarcusbach/status/992003069763244032). That is not what I am talking about.
 
Over the years I have encountered developer heroics in almost every company I worked at. These heroes are often known by management for getting things to work fast in the face of a looming deadline. Or they are the ones the company constantly relies on for saving the day when the shit hits the fan in production. These developers throw themselves in the midst of "battle" time and time again. Saving the day. To their fellow software developers they often have the reputation of being very 'smart', for being true experts. 

Oh, what would we do without them?

## Wild west


In the case of hero developers I often think of them as the cowboy gunslingers from the wild west. You know, the classic cowboys that draw fast and shoot straight. Who ride in to town, save the day in an epic gun fight. And then ride of in the sunset. As a kid, who did not aspire to be such a hero? 

The residents of the town in the wild west are happy when they are saved by this hero. The danger has been averted, evil doers slain. Oh happy days! The gunslinger is loved and admired. Perhaps even worshipped. After a while there can even form a little group centered around the hero gunslinger. The hero that everyone relies on and tries to imitate. Whom is loved by all... 

### Types of heroes

Now of course there are all kinds of different heroes, cowboys and gunslingers roaming the wild west. Using my wild west metaphor I have made a humble attempt to note down the different types of heroes that I myself have encountered over the years.  

*TODO: Als je betere namen hebt, shoot*

#### The young buck

This type of 'hero' is for me typically the young naive buck. The young gunslinger full of high ideals, with a simplistic sense of justice, who is doing all the fighting and taking all the risks. But often gets played for a fool and lets someone else reaps the benefit. He might even get scorned and chased away by the very people he was fighting for. 

The mainly see themselves as a hero, if they are lucky they are also appreciated by the people they are helping. But they don't realise that they are often just used for canon fodder and for doing the dirty work. 

#### The lone ranger

Another type of hero is a person who is more of loner. They get the job done by themselves, work alone. Always there to save the day that needs constant saving.

Some take pride in their lone ranger actions, bot others would very much like to put an end to the necessity of it and live a quiet happy life. But circumstances won't let them.

#### The posse 

The posse is a rowdy bunch that has taken justice in their own hands. They have thrown themselves in the midst of things. They are loyal to each other and stick together. But they can lose track of the purpose of their actions. constantly in the midst of things they have no time to think how they can prevent future troubles.

Just like lone rangers, some posses take pride in their heroics actions. Others are doing it because they don't see an alternative. Depending on how long a posse runs they can be viewed initially as heroes but run the risk that over time people start seeing them as a necessary evil that they much rather get rid of.

#### The hero gunslinger

The fastest gunslingers are often the hero of the pack. Their skills have given them a reputation as saviors, the ones who know best. Tales of their heroic exploits have bolstered their reputation, allwoing them to get away with things the common folks wouldn't.

The gunslingers are mostly placed on a pedestal by their peers. Sometimes they or even worshipped by some. They are the ones people turn to and place their trust in. All too often this is also linked their ego. Because who doesn't like to be loved, to be the 'leader'. 

#### The terrorizing gunslinger

This type of 'hero' you get when you get a dictator instead of a leader. It often goes hand in hand with the hero gunslinger. Depending if you oppose them, heroes can become dictators ruling by brute force and by the political weight that was given to them. Who would dare to go against the will of the hero of the people.

Often feared instead of loved by his peers the terrorizing gunslinger still appears a hero to the people of the town. Their heroes still get the job done and the townspeople care about the results. They don't need to work with gunslinger themselves.

### The problems with heroes

The townspeople are sure lucky to have heroes around willing to save them and maintain law and order. However what the residents of the town really need is for the wild west to be tamed. In the wild west they need to rely on the heroes but they would much prefer it if the heroes were no longer necessary. That they can continue to steadily work, expand, grow their city. Go about their business and improve their lives. 

The townspeople need to rely on the law enforcers to keep the town safe. Where some of the law enforcers are regarded as heroes, other can be viewed as a necessary evil.  Where the townspeople hope for a safe environment, they often need to rely on hero gunslingers to quell any outlaw uprising. All the while they desire a future where violent episodes never occur again, where they can reliably predict the future without needing to live in constant fear. But often they do not know that there is another way..
 
 What they really need is a _professional_ reliable law enforcement. One that nips all trouble in the but, well before it occurs. From whom the people don't even know that they are there. The townspeople can just safely work in their software. Excuse me, town.

## Back to the software

I have chosen the wild west metaphor because the software industry has some resemblance to its wild nature. We are still a young industry that is frequently revolutionized by the next "new" thing. We are still moving frontiers. Us, the tech savy experts, feel safe there but for others it can be a scary place. They need to rely on us and pray that we know what we are doing. 

In my little wild west comparison the residents of the town are of course the customers, the town is the software, the enforcers of the law are the software developers.

Now let me explain the different types of heroes that I see in the software industry. And the problems associated with them.

### The young buck

In the software world I have seen these 'young buck' hero typically in a consulting context. The young developers, with little experience, starting with a consultancy firm. They are the ones te most easy to convince that they need to put in the time, work hard, pull late nighters, work in the weekends, to make that big deadline. Often of some fixed-prize waterfall project that was bound to fail from the start. Yes, people still do big waterfall projects. Remember Obama care? [^obama-cio]

The developers that are doing this hard work, rushing from deadline to deadline, often do this from a misplaced sense of pride. Perhaps even a sense of professionalism. Look at us working hard, getting things done. Our company and customer will be so proud... 

It is precisely that sense of taking pride in doing 'heroic' deeds that categorizes them for me as the young buck. I've certainly seen older consultants do yet another project with crazy arbitrary deadlines. But usually they have long lost the pride part and are doing it because it pays the bills or advances their career with the boss. They do it consciously.
    
The young buck hero was for me what Sandro Mancuso discussed in a very recognizable way in chapter 5 of his book [The Software Craftsman](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Craftsman-Professionalism-Pragmatism-Robert/dp/0134052501/) [^sandroBook]. Being a hero may make you feel good about yourself, that you are saving the day, making crazy deadlines, doing a lot of overtime... 

Often the only one who benefits form these heroics is the young bucks boss. Who get's paid by the customer for the work and overtime. Of course often a bone will be thrown towards the ones doing the actual work. But it isn't the boss that is sitting there in the weekends, pulling an all nighter...

Even if the deadline is met the customer is often left with very poorly written software which a high maintenance cost. Did I mention Obama care[^obama-cbs] ? I could of course mention a lot of belgian projects as well. The young bucks may feel like heroes while they are rushing for the deadline, doing quick fixes, patch job after path job in production but in the lomg run it is the software that suffers and the customer that will overpay for a low quality product.


### The lone ranger

The lone rangers are the software engineers who are always on call, always there when the shits hit the fan. They are the lone ranger that always saves the day. But no one really knows what is going on. This is a type of 'hero' that I have come across on several occasions as well. Almost always the case the hero was barely keeping everything a float, trying to catch a break, keeping up the illusion that everything is under control, hoping to eventually get their life back. Often no one really knows how bad the situation is because there is only one who knows what is really going on.

> Due to a lack of knowledge, discipline, or ability to say no, things have gotten out of control. 

The lone ranger often runs the risk for a burnout. Which is especially dangerous since they can't be missed. They are often revered by the customer, since they are the ones saving the day. For now...

### The posse 

The posse is essentially the same this as the lone ranger but now it occurs in a team context. When you have a team that is constantly 'fixing' things. Things that no one else knows about. When most of the teams time is spent on operational problems, then there is a serious problem. A problem that should be addressed asap. before it makes the evening news...
 
If the posse team consists out of the same people that developed the systems in the first place then the problem is even bigger. Because then you are effectively paying  the outlaws to maintain the order in town...
