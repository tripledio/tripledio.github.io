# Socrates Be 2022

A lazy sunny Sunday evening. I just got back refreshed from the [Socrates BE 2022 un-conference](https://socratesbe.org) and decided to share some positive vibes I brought with me.

## What is it?

For those of you who don't know, Socrates BE is the Belgian Software Craftsmanship community, that
organizes regular [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/socratesbe/) at several locations throughout Belgium (Kortrijk, Gent, Leuven...).
The [un-conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) that took place this weekend was a two day event
where Software Crafters got together to sharpen their skills and have a good time.

## The conference

This year, because of Covid, the conference was held during the summer period which meant that the weather was really nice.
There were 45 attendees in total, including the entire Triple D team. Sadly some usual suspects were unable to attend because of the holiday season.
There were some new faces, some old faces. Some young people and some somewhat older people (ahem).
Since it was the holiday season, some people brought the family along which gave the whole conference a real vacation vibe. The next generation of Triple D'ers definitely enjoyed it, although that might have had something to do with the ice cream.

Most people arrived thursday evening around 18h. Some people arrived earlier, some much later. As is in the spirit of
the un-conference, there are no hard, fixed timings so the conference started on the terras with a La Chouffe in the
evening sun. Greeting old friends, meeting new friends. Catching up after this whole Covid thing. At 20h we went to
dinner and at 22u30ish we got together for a short, practical introduction. After which there was some more socializing.

Friday morning at 9ish, despite Erik being up and about at 9 am sharp, we kicked of the un-conference with a general
introduction where Erik explained the spirit and flow to everyone. Me personally was already preparing a code repo for a
session I wanted to do in the bar. But obviously I was present when we started the marketplace so I could present a couple of 
topics I wanted to tackle. At 11 the agenda for the first day was finished and the conference was in full swing.

## The sessions

There were too many interesting sessions and topics to discuss them all here. But I'll give a quick summary of the
sessions I attended.

![marketplace](/img/posts/socrates22/marketplace1.jpg){:width="500px" : .center-image :margin=10px}

+ Are humans natural state Good or Evil?

A session where the host of the session was unable to attend because he got caught up in another session. And that's ok.
An interesting discussion still took place. *Whoever shows up, are the right people.*

+ Let's implement Git

A cool session hosted by [Michel](https://twitter.com/michelgrootjans) where the group mobbed on implementing Git themselves.
Very instructive.

+ Let's BDD poker

A session where we mobbed on implementing poker in kotlin starting from BDD scenarios. Note that not everyone
knew kotlin, but that's just one more learning experience and did not hold us back at all. Mobbing is a very good
technique for this. Main interesting discussion here was on the level of detail that tended to creep in the BDD scenarios and
what should or shouldn't be moved to a unit test.

+ Team Topologies applied

A session from [Tim](https://twitter.com/TimSchraepen) where we discussed the ideas of the Team Topologies book and how
to apply them. An interesting view point from [Mathew](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bnathyuw/) for me was

> When the level of required communication is greater than the level of actual communication. You can choose to
> communicate more. But this only scales so far before it just all becomes distracting noise. Or you can lower the amount
> of communication required. This can be done by organising the teams so that minimal cross team communication is needed.

+ Mob programming the hard parts

This was a session of mine because I was interested in peoples practical problems when practicing Mob programming. The
group shared some of their experiences, I shared some of mine.
My takeaway is this: Senior people can easily forget how much knowledge they have accumulated and how intimidating it can
be as a junior to join a group of impatient seniors. And when people are stressed, their brain stops working.

+ Why you should become an IT-manager

A session that we held in the open air. As it was a software conference I was pleasantly surprised that more
than 20 people showed up for session on management. And we had a lively and interesting discussion.

One of the nice quotes of that discussion I'll shamelessly steal is:

> As a developer you have quick feedback from your code. As a manager everything takes much longer, it goes slower.
> But the impact you can have, the change you can bring about as a manager can be much bigger than you can accomplish as
> a lone developer.


These were just some of the sessions that were hosted during those two days. But the important part for me is that, at
an un-conference, I'm as free as a bird. I walk in and out of different sessions. Sometimes I decided to attend no
session. To do a little coding, take a walk, or just have a chat.

## The evenings

In the evenings, after dinner, the group went back to the venue for some lightening talks, board games and football with
the kids. When the kids went to bed there was the traditional Whiskey tasting available, which paired really well with the
board games :-)

## The end

Sunday morning, not being really awake due to late night gaming followed by some discussions, we had breakfast together.
After that we had to say goodbye and everyone went home. Batteries fully charged :)

## Close at heart

The Socrates Be community and its conference lies close to our heart. The idea of Triple D originated in one of the first conferences.
Over the years we were able to work together with several of the community members. That is why we are proud to be a sponsor and why we love helping to organize this great event.
