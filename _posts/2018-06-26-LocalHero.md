# The Local hero

_This post belongs to small series of posts. The main post is [Wild west heroes](/31/05/2018/Heroes/)._
 
My main metaphor throughout these posts on heroic behaviour has been the wild west. There the fastest gunslingers often are the hero of the pack. Their heroic actions have given them a reputation as saviours, those you can rely on, the ones who know best. Their reputations have sometimes risen to legendary. Tales of their heroic exploits have bolstered their reputation far outside the realm of their immediate environment. To most of the locals, they are Heroes.

These gunslingers are mostly placed on a pedestal by their peers. Sometimes the heroes practically gets even worshipped by some of their peers. The more people that place the hero on a pedestal, the more their reputation grows, the more people potentially turn to them and start *following* them. 

### Software Heroes

Now how does this relate to software development? In the software world the heroes in a company are those software developers that carry a lot of weight with their peers, often with management as well. Through whatever actions they did in the past they have earned a good reputation and are considered to be very valuable, almost indispensable. 

So lets discuss some of the dangers that lurk in having Heroes around.

#### Ego <a name="ego"/>

When people are constantly relying on someone, give much weight to their opinions, delegate their judgement to them, basically placing them onto a pedestal they run the risk that the object of their 'worship' will start losing objectivity. Even when the heroes have the best of intentions - and not all heroes necessarily do - it is hard to not get too full of yourselves when everyone considers you exceptional. That's why I deem these 'local heroes' dangerous because they often come with a huge ego. If not now then later. 

Now as software developers, we often tend to couple our ego to our knowledge and intelligence. I think it is our equivalent of quick-draws. Showing who's best. But allow me to quote this little tweet:

> The smartest people I know:
>
> 1. Admit they know very little
> 2. Constantly seek more info
> 3. Encourage intellectual debate
> 4. Have strong opinions, loosely held
> 5. Are comfortable being wrong
> 6. Surround themselves with great people
> 7. Realize life isn't black & white
> 8. Fear bias & arrogance

If one really feels the need to, there are better ways of demonstrating one's intelligence then always wanting to be right. Which is pretty self-evident, we all know this in our day to day life. But in the workplace, this is apparently more easily forgotten.

A little mental check that I do is keeping track if I ever heard someone admit that they were wrong or saw them change their minds by someones else argument. When someone can never admit a mistake I try to avoid getting into an argument with them altogether. Personally, I start placing little value on their opinion or 'arguments'. Because they aren't being honest.

> They are not trying to help, they are trying to win...

Of course, it is normal that people argue and defend their points of view. To a certain point. We all have this to some degree. But if someone is truly incapable of decoupling their ego from their solution then it is impossible to have a meaningful conversation. Because their ego does not permit them to admit that they are not omniscient. So there is really no point in debating them. You are just wasting time and money.

Unfortunately, depending on their hero status in a group, getting involved with them may be unavoidable. If the local hero has a loyal following, then that can even produce an organizational risk and you'll need to deal with their minions as well.

*For more on loyality and heroics see [the Posse](/20/06/2018/Posse/)*

Even when someone is capable of keeping their ego in check, being 'worshipped' is still not a good thing. Even though somewhere deep down we all like to be the object of adoration. Worship runs the risk of stifling the heroes own growth because they are no longer being properly challenged. The heroes can get lazily in their thinking, get too used to 'being right'. The ego gets inflated, losing touch with reality. And no matter how good they are, they become less valuable.

#### No ownership

For the team, the heroes peers, having heroes around isn't without risk as well. The danger of having a Local hero is that the team gets lazy, that they stifle their own growth. Because after a while the hero is no longer questioned. Just follow the leader of the pack, be safe, take it easy. 

When there are heroes around, people often don't take ownership themselves. They feel secure in the presence of heroes. Or intimidated. They run the risk of becoming complacent, just following along, not challenging the leader but also not challenging themselves. No responsibility needs to be taken. People run the risk of not living up to their own full potential. This way, heroes often block the team members from using the full potential. Which is not only a waste but also dangerous.
     
Decisions can get postponed until they get approval by a hero. Because people don't want to make the decision, take the responsibility themselves. Or run the risk that a decision taken when the hero was absent will be immediately overturned when the hero returns. This not only starts resembling a dictatorship but it turns the hero into a bottleneck. 
     
This passive behaviour is very dangerous for the software and the company. Because we are all humans.
     
> No one can know everything, think of everything or is infallible. 
  
Even if you should have found some of those mythical infallible IT-heroes, even they can not be everywhere at the same time. The team needs to ready and competent to handle everything without the heroes being around.  

That is why we need everyone to pitch in, using all the brain power available. Even when there are people that are more knowledgeable, experienced or 'smarter' then you, allow yourself the grow and don't remain in the hero shadow. 

>It is ok that people seek guidance or mentoring. It is not ok if they stop thinking for themselves.

#### Minions  <a name="minions"/>

Dominating heroes also can complicate the political landscape. It can happen that a little cult of followers starts forming around one person. Apart from the ownership issues, this is also a dangerous thing politically. It adds the additional complexity that next to the existing organizational silo's typically present in an organisation, there is an additional group that can possibly run across organizational boundaries and strive for their own political aims. In this case, the leader of the hero cult may gain more power than the organization/ customer is willing to consciously give to them. 

The group of minions also can lead to a certain tribalism, a certain group pressure. Us vs them. Where they can gang up on someone outside of the group, under the protection of the leader. This can lead to competent people leaving the firm because they aren't willing to play petty politics and are unable to do a proper job. Again, the customer loses.

### Conclusion

The danger of the heroes lies not so much with the heroes themselves. But more with the impact, they have on their peers. More specifically, the impact their peers allow them to have. The heroes need to take care that they don't become **bullies**, that they keep their ego in check. [^jocko] But they aren't responsible for any passive, worshipping attitude that their peers may have. 

As an employer having your own local heroes may seem comforting and reassuring. Everyone speaks so highly of them, we should treasure them. Just make sure that even the legends can take a vacation or, heaven forbids, change jobs. No one sticks around forever. Everyone must do their part. It is a good thing that the business can place their trust in their software engineers. But this should be the logical consequence of the team doing a consistently good job. No worship should come into play.

A little tip to my fellow heroic super intelligent software engineers out there: Be humble!
 
Seriously. Everyone wants to be special. But no one knows everything and everyone makes mistakes. Even if it is so much cooler to be a ninja than a janitor. A [janitor](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/991421712989208576) is useful. Constantly learning and improving yourself is definitely an admirable trait. Just don't turn into a Bully. 

When I am looking for people to work with I am looking at their mentality first. No matter how competent or genius you are, the 'mission' comes first. We are all smart people. But can we work together?
