At Triple D we value quality above quantity. We do not aim to be a big company, but we strive to be a great one. A company where people are proud to be a part of. So even though the need for IT specialists is bigger than ever before, we’re somewhat picky, despite the omnipresent war on talent. We’re looking for skilled software engineers but far and foremost, we are looking for people who can relate to our mindset, values and work ethic.


## What are we looking for?

So what are we looking for during the respocruitement process? Of course, we want you to be highly skilled in software engineering and passionate about your job. But that’s what every IT company wants. So what else are we looking for?
            
Some core values we look for:

### Ownership

We genuinely appreciate responsibility, ownership and accountability on all levels. Our aversion to finger pointing and blaming is equally genuine. Blaming and criticizing is easy. Let's make things better!

### Knowledge sharing

We look for people that are happy to share their knowledge with their colleagues and other teams, people not afraid to re-inject their gained expertise into the organization. People who strive to make themselves expandable. Because the team should always be able to continue the mission, no one should be indipensable. 

### Humility

Ego, the destroyer of teams.  While we are looking for talented, knowledgeable people we are not looking for heroes, know-it-alls. No one is omniscient or infallible, not even Superman. we want to work with people who are able to admit when they are wrong and listen in order to understand what’s really going on. A little humility never hurt nobody. We want to be able to have constructive and honest discussions where everyone strives for the best solution. Not "their" solution. We are especially wary of this one...

### Dare to speak up and communicate

No communication means no teamwork. Communication should happen in a team, between teams, up and down the “chain of command”. A successful collaboration starts with yourself: ask for help and advice, but offer the same things in return. Are you having concerns or do you disagree on a matter? Dare to speak up! Don't grumble in a corner.

### Trust and respect

Everyone wants to work in a safe environment. A place where you can speak your mind, voice your opinions and propose a solution without being ridiculed, intimidated or afraid. So when giving feedback or debating problems and solutions, you’re always
respectful and open for input from others. An equal voice in a safe environment. No bullying, intimidation or any passive aggressive BS. Working together should be a source of joy.

### Intellectual curiosity

We are looking for people that have the intellectual curiosity to learn, and the capacity to grow. Nobody knows everything, we work in a field that is continuously evolving and expanding. So rather than quizzing you on the latest technologies and frameworks, we look for your ability to learn. How comfortable are you not knowing? How quick can you learn? What motivates you to learn? 

> “We can learn a lot from a company, team, and individuals just by paying attention to how they interview.” ― Sandro Mancuso, The Software Craftsman

## Our recruitment process

After elaborating a bit on what we are looking for during the recruitment process, let's discuss the recruitment process at Triple D.

Now let’s dive into our screening process and find out if there’s a final match!
Screening process: a job at De Persgroep IT in 4 steps

### Quick introduction

When you contact us because you are curious about working at Triple D, we set up a quick introduction through a phone call or online meeting. So we can have a 15 minute conversation where we introduce ourselves to each other so that we can check if there is a match or not before both of us commit to going further with the recruitment process. Because it does require some effort from both sides.  

### Upfront coding exercise

We start with a coding exercise, which you can do at home in your spare time. You don’t want pressure as an
uninvited guest in your performance. Stress is not part of our screening process and we want you to be proud
of your submitted solution.
Of course, the difficulty of the test depends on the profile and related experience we’re looking for. The

exercise allows us to:
Gain insight in your way of thinking
Evaluate your coding skills
Have a meaningful conversation about coding practices

### The interview

The coding exercise is the perfect starter for your conversation with us. Because an interview is always subjectiev we always interview in pair, so we can have multiple impressions of the interviews. During the interview we’ll go into a variety of topics to discuss. Note that it’s not a buzzword bingo. We will not be asking things you can quickly google. It’s okay not to know. Rather than questioning you on the latest API’s
or frameworks, we’ll try to assess both your technical skills as your mindset. The interview is a conversation where both parties are trying to sell themselves. So there is plenty of time and opportunity to ask questions yourselve. 

### Feedback

We always give feedback, no matter the outcome of the interview. We inform you on how we experienced the interview, our impressions of you as a person and how we assessed your technical skills. This is not a one-way street: we’re also eager to learn how you experienced the interview and how we can improve ourselves.

### Go or No go

We will give you our decision after the interview as soon as possible. Often within 15 minutes and no later than the next day in case the interview was late. If it was a Go we move on to the contractual proposal. if it was a no Go, there are definitely no hard feelings. we know we make a subjective call, that could very well be wrong. But we rather risk to missing out on a great hire than running the risk of hiring someone who is not a great fit.
