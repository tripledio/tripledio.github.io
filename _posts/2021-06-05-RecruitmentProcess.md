# Joining Triple-D

At Triple D we value quality above quantity. We do not aim to be a big company, but we strive to be a great one. A company that people are proud to be a part of. So even though the need for IT specialists is bigger than ever before, we’re somewhat picky, despite the omnipresent war on talent. of course we’re looking for skilled software engineers but far and foremost, we are looking for people who can relate to our mindset, values and work ethic. So in this post we will elaborate on our recruitment process, wo we are looking for and how we go about finding them.

## What we are looking for

So what are we looking for during the recruitment process? Of course, we want you to be highly skilled in software engineering and passionate about your job. But that’s what every IT company wants. So what else are we looking for? What do we value?
            
#### Ownership

We genuinely appreciate responsibility, ownership and accountability on all levels. Our aversion to finger pointing and blaming is equally genuine. Blaming and criticizing is easy. Let's make things better!

#### Knowledge sharing

We look for people that are happy to share their knowledge with their colleagues and other teams, people not afraid to re-inject their gained expertise into the organization. People who strive to make themselves expandable. Because the team should always be able to continue the mission, no one should be indipensable. 

#### Humility

Ego, the destroyer of teams.  While we are looking for talented, knowledgeable people we are not looking for heroes, know-it-alls. No one is omniscient or infallible, not even Superman. we want to work with people who are able to admit when they are wrong and listen in order to understand what’s really going on. A little humility never hurt nobody. We want to be able to have constructive and honest discussions where everyone strives for the best solution. Not "their" solution. We are especially wary of this one...

#### Communication

No communication means no teamwork. Communication should happen in a team, between teams, up and down the “chain of command”. A successful collaboration starts with yourself: ask for help and advice, but offer the same things in return. Are you having concerns or do you disagree on a matter? Dare to speak up! Don't grumble in a corner.

#### Trust and respect

Everyone wants to work in a safe environment. A place where you can speak your mind, voice your opinions and propose a solution without being ridiculed, intimidated or afraid. So when giving feedback or debating problems and solutions, you’re always
respectful and open for input from others. An equal voice in a safe environment. No bullying, intimidation or any passive aggressive BS. Working together should be a source of joy.

#### Intellectual curiosity

We are looking for people that have the intellectual curiosity to learn, and the capacity to grow. Nobody knows everything, we work in a field that is continuously evolving and expanding. So rather than quizzing you on the latest technologies and frameworks, we look for your ability to learn. How comfortable are you not knowing? How quick can you learn? What motivates you to learn?

## The recruitment process

After elaborating a bit on what we are looking for during the recruitment process, let's discuss the recruitment process at Triple D. The recruitment process consist out of several steps as illustrated below. 

![Recruitment Process](/img/posts/recruitment/recruitment-process.jpg)

Let's discuss the steps one by one.

![Quick Introduction](/img/posts/recruitment/intro.jpg){:width="200px"} 

When you contact us because you are curious about working at Triple D, we set up a quick introduction through a phone call or online meeting. This way we can have a 15-minute conversation where we introduce ourselves to each other. This allows both parties a quick and easy wat to check if there is a match or not before they commit to going any further with the recruitment process. The process does require some effort from both sides, so we want to make sure all parties are convinced it's worth investing the time in. This is not an "interview" conversation, but a "what are you loonking for" conversation.

![Exercise](/img/posts/recruitment/making-exercise.jpg){:width="200px"} 

The coding exercise is an important step in the process. We like to use an actual piece of software as a basis for the interview conversation. This assignment serves multiple purposes:

+ give us an insight in your mindset and way of thinking
+ give us an insight in your technical and coding skills
+ give us a use case we all know so that we quickly can have a deep discussion on software design and architecture
+ allows you to elaborate on your coding disciplines and practices

We ask you to make the exercise in your own time so that stress isn’t a factor. We don’t want pressure on you. We hope you can find the time to do your best work and are proud of the result. So take all the time you need for the exercise. If you are unable to find the time to make the exercise the way you want it to make, then let us know. We can always reschedule the interview. The most important part is that you are proud of your work before we dive into it.

The exercise has different levels taking into account the different profiles and experience we’re looking for. The goal is not "to get it right" or how you suspect we want it to be done. You should do it the way you want to do it. That way we can have a good, meaningful conversation about it.

We are aware that the exercise does take some effort to make. We hope this encourages people to step up and take on the "challenge".

![Interview](/img/posts/recruitment/interview.jpg){:width="200px"} 

The interview is typically a two hour comversation where the coding exercise will serve as the kickoff and main theme. Naturally we can go wherever the conversation takes us that is relevant for both parties. Because an interview is always subjective, we always interview in pair, so we can have multiple impressions of the interviews. During the interview we’ll go into a variety of topics to discuss. Note that it will not be a buzzword bingo. We will not be asking things you can quickly look up. So it’s okay not to know. Rather than questioning you on the latest API’s or frameworks, we’ll try to assess both your technical skills as your mindset. 

The interview is a conversation where both parties are trying to sell themselves. So there is plenty of time and opportunity to ask questions yourselves. We encourage it. That way we can get a better idea of what you find important as well.

![Feedback](/img/posts/recruitment/feedback.jpg){:width="200px"}

We will give you our decision after the interview as soon as possible. Often within 15 minutes and no later than the next day in case the interview was late.

Apart from giving you a quick decision, we will always give feedback, no matter the outcome of the interview. We inform you on how we experienced the interview, our impressions of you as a person and how we assessed your technical skills. This is where our work comes in, because we take this seriously and go in depth. 

Feedback is of course not a one-way street: we’re also eager to learn how you experienced the interview and how we can improve ourselves.

![Proposal](/img/posts/recruitment/proposal.jpg){:width="200px"}

If both parties are looking forwrd to further collaboration, then we move on to the contractual proposal and hiring! 

![Later](/img/posts/recruitment/later.jpg){:width="200px"}

If Triple D decides not to go further with the recruitment process, there are definitely no hard feelings. We know we make a subjective call, that could very well be wrong. As guideline, we rather risk to missing out on a great hire than running the risk of hiring someone who is not a great fit. 

Although we definitely invest a lot in the training of our people, it might be that we are not sure if the drive is there. However, if you prove us wrong we are more than willing to reconsider at a later time when we see that someone has clearly made an investment in themselves.

If you yourself decide not to go further with the recruitment process, again no hard feelings. We would still appreciate any feedback you can give us on how you experienced to process.

## Motivations

Why do we it this way? This process is time-consuming and does require some work from both parties?

#### The importance of a good fit

We want to make sure that there is a great fit, our goal is not to grow for growth's sake. That's why we rather risk of missing out on a great hire than running the risk of hiring someone who is not a great fit. 

#### Exercise

The exercise does take some effort to make, with no guarantee of success. We hope this motivates passionate people and serves as a basic safeguard. At Triple D we are always learning, so this kind of exercises can hopefully be viewed with enthusiasm.  

#### Interview 

An in depth exercise and deep interview with multiple people help us to make an informed decision as much as possible. So we take our time for the interview and the exercise really helps us to go deep.

#### Feedback

We all had those job interviews where they tell you they will let you know something, and you never hear from them again. We don't want to be that kind a company. 

Giving and receiving feedback is of course an important way to grow for both parties involved.   


## Summary

This is the process that we are currently following. Our main goal is to have a proper in depth conversation with each other and have some idea where the candidates are at. The drive to learn and grow, a constructive mindset are the most important properties we look at. Where the software engineering skills that someone has obtained mostly serve as proof for those properties.
