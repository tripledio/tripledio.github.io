# The Local hero

*This post belongs to small series of posts. The main post is [Wild west heroes](/20/05/2018/Heroes/).*
 
In this post I'll go into a bit more detail what I identify as the Local "hero" pattern. In my main metaphor of the wild west, the fastest gunslingers are often the hero of the pack. Their actions have given them a reputation as saviors, those you can rely on, the ones who know best. Their reputations have risen to legendary. Tales of their heroic exploits have bolstered their reputation far outside the realm of their immediate environment.

These gunslingers are mostly placed on a pedestal by their peers. Sometimes they or even worshipped by some. They are the ones people turn to and place their trust in. All too often this is also linked their ego. Because who doesn't like to be loved, to be the 'leader', to be seen as infallible? 

The hero are those software developers that carry a lot of weight with their peers, often with management as well. Through whatever actions they did in the past they have earned a good reputation and are considered to be very valuable, almost indispensable. 

However when people constantly rely on someone, give much weight to their opinions, delegate their judgement to them, basically placing them onto a pedestal this runs the risk that the object of their 'worship' will start losing objectivity. Even when the heroes have the best of intentions, and not all heroes necessarily do, it is hard to not get too full of yourselves when everyone considers you exceptional. That's why I deem these 'legendary' heroes dangerous because they often come with a huge ego. 

## Ego

As software developers we often tend to couple or ego to our knowledge and intelligence. I think it is our equivalent of quick draws. Showing who's bests. But allow me to quote this little tweet:

> The smartest people I know:
>
> 1. Admit they know very little
> 2. Constantly seek more info
> 3. Encourage intellectual debate
> 4. Have strong opinions, loosely held
> 5. Are comfortable being wrong
> 6. Surrounded by best people
> 7. Realize life isn't black & white
> 8. Fear bias & arrogance

If one really feels the need to, there are better ways of demonstrating ones intelligence then always wanting to be right. Which is pretty self evident, we all kow this in our day to day life. But at the workplace this is apparently more easy forgotten.

A little mental check that I do is keeping track if I ever heard someone admitting that they where wrong or saw them change their minds by someones else argument. When someone can never admit a mistake I try to avoid getting into an argument with them altogether. Personally I start placing little value on their opinion or 'arguments'. Because they aren't being honest.

> They are not trying to help, they are trying to win...

Of course it is normal that people argue and defend their points of view. To a certain point. We all have this to some degree. But if someone is truly incapable of decoupling their ego from their solution then it is impossible to have a meaningful conversation. Because their ego does not permit them to admit that they are not omniscient. So there is really no point in debating them. You are just waisting time and money.

Unfortunately depending on their hero status in a group, getting involved with them may be unavoidable. If the legendary hero has a loyal following, then that can produce even an organizational risk and you'll need to deal with their minions as well.

## Hero cripples growth

Even when someone is capable of keeping their ego in check, being 'worshipped' is still not a good thing. Even if perhaps somewhere deep down we all would like it. At the one hand worship runs the risk of stifling the heroes own growth because they are not being properly challenged. The heroes can get lazily in their thinking, get to used to 'being right'. The ego gets inflated, loosing touch with reality. And no matter how good they are, they become less valuable...

## No ownership

For the team heroes aren't without risk as well. The danger is that the team gets lazy, that they stifle their own growth. Because after a while the hero is no longer questioned. Just follow the leader of the pack, be safe, take it easy. 

When there are heroes around, people often don't take ownership themselves. They feel secure in the presence of heroes. Or intimidated. They run the risk of becoming complacent, just following along, not challenging the leader but also not challenging themselves. No responsibility needs to be taken. People run the risk of not living up to their own full potential. This way, heroes often block the team members from using the full potential. Which is not only a waste but also dangerous.
     
Decisions can get postponed until they get approval by a hero. Because people don't want to make the decision, take the responsibility themselves. Or run the risk that a decision taken when the hero was absent will be immediately overturned when the hero returns. This not only starts resembling a dictatorship but it turns the hero into a bottleneck. 
     
This passive behaviour is very dangerous for the software and the company. Because we are all humans.
     
> No one can know everything, think of everything or is infallible. 
  
Even if you should have found some of those infallible IT-heroes, even they can not be everywhere at the same time. The team needs to ready and competent to handle everything without the heroes being around.  

That is why we need everyone to pitch in, using all the brain power available. Even when there are people that are more knowledgable, experienced or 'smarter' then you, allow yourself the grow and don't remain in the hero shadow. 

>It is ok that people seek guidance or mentoring. It is not ok if they stop thinking for themselves.

## Minions

Dominating heroes also can complicate the political landscape. It can happen that a little cult of followers starts forming around one person. Apart from the ownership issues, this is also a dangerous thing politically. It adds the additional complexity that next to the existing organizational silo's often present in a organisation, there is an additional group that can possibly run across organizational boundaries and strive for their own political aims. In this case the leader of the hero cult may gain more power than the organization/ customer is willing to consciously give to them. 

The group of minions also can lead to a certain tribalism, a certain group pressure. Us vs them. Where they can gang up on someone outside of the group, under the protection of the leader. This can lead to competent people leaving the firm because they aren't willing to play petty politics and are unable to do a proper job. Again, the customer loses.

## Lead

The danger of the legendary heroes lies not so much with the heroes themselves. But more with the impact they have on their peers. Or rather the impact their peers **allow** them to have. The heroes need to take care that they don't become bullies, that they keep their ego in check. [^jocko] But they aren't responsible for any passive, worshipping attitude that their peers may have. It is a good thing that software engineers have the confidence  of the business. But this should be the  logical consequence of the team doing a consistent good job. Heroics shouldn't be necessary. 

## Conclusion

For the people needing to rely on software engineers: 

Having your own **Local heroes** may seem comforting and reassuring. Everyone speaks so highly of them, we should treasure them. Just make sure that the even the legends can take a vacation of change jobs. No one sticks around for ever. Everyone must do their part.

For my fellow heroic super intelligent software engineers out there: 

A little tip that is useful everywhere in life: **Be humble** Seriously. Everyone wants to be special. But no one knows everything and everyone makes mistakes. Even if it is so much cooler to be a ninja than a janitor. A [janitor](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/991421712989208576) is useful. 

 Constantly learning and improving yourself is definitely an admirable trait. Just don't turn into a [Bully](/14/05/2018/Bully/). When I am looking for people to work with I am looking to their mentality first. No matter how competent or genius you are, the 'mission' comes first. We are all smart people. But can we work together?
