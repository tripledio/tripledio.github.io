# The importance of Lead Time

Lead time is an important measurement. It is the time it takes for us to deliver something. It is an important measurement to optimize for because it measures the whole flow, not just a part, from the customer perspective.

> Lead Time is a customer measurement.

The importance of Lead time as something to optimize for originates from the manufacturing world, but it applies to the software world as wel. We want to optimize lead time because we want to optimize the whole system. This is why in software we have the following definition for lead time, established by the [Poppendiecks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development):

>**Lead time** refers to the total time it takes to deliver a feature or code change to production, from the moment itâ€™s first conceived as a user story or feature request.

## The scope of lead time

Where the definition should be clear, there is still often debate when exactly it begins and when it ends. So let's discuss this in more detail.

## Where does Lead Time begin

An argument one often hears is that lead time should only start when all the requirements are clear. Because the comparison is made with manufacturing where lead time begins once an order is received. The argument is that lead time for software development can only start when the feature request, the order, is completely clear.

However, there is an error in that comparison. Taking manufacturing examples as an argument that the requirements need to be perfectly clear does not hold because Software development is knowledge work, not manufacturing work. We are designing new products, not simply manufacturing existing ones.

**Manufacturing work** is producing a product that is already known. When I order a spaghetti in a restaurant, the lead time is from when I place my order until it is on my plate. The specs are clear, we all know what a spaghetti is, the recipe is prescribed and anyone can manufacture it. In the software industry, the manufacturing step is automated and takes almost no effort. The code is the recipe. Once the recipe is known, we can produce an instance of the application in a matter of minutes in almost infinite amounts.

**Knowledge work** is trying to solve a problem. We are designing a new product. For instance creating a new recipe for a new dish in your restaurant. Creating a new recipe requires investigation and feedback. Is this what we want? Does it taste like we want? One continuously improves, tastes and iterates over the recipe. The cooking part, once the recipe is known, can then be automated, written out in simple steps so anyone can do it. The hard part is coming up with the recipe.

If you recognise Lead Time as the time from the customer perspective, then the definition does hold for manufacturing as well as for knowledge work. It starts when the request comes in from the customer. The request for a spaghetti, or the request for a new great dish. One produces food, the other a recipe.

When the business ask us a new feature, they are asking for a new recipe with certain requirements. How we are going to do it, what all the exact requirements are, isn't typically clear. Although the business may disagree with that statement :) But helping to create a product, that is part of the job. And what makes it interesting.

Only starting to measure once all the requirements are done, is only measuring a fraction of the time it takes us, as an organisation, to produce a recipe. For the business the clock started ticking when they launched their requests. It is up to us to iterate together with them to get to a good end result.

If we take 3 months to analyse a request before we start on it, even if delivery then only takes a month, we will deliver far too late. From the customers perspective it took us 4 months. Therefore we need to look, optimize the speed of the whole process, including analysis. Because from the customer perspective, it is all part of one system.

## Where does Lead Time end

When does the lead time end? When development is done? When it is deployed to STG? When it is tested? When it is deployed?

As is hopefully clear from the definition, Lead Time ends when the feature is delivered in production. Not when an certain role job is done. If development is done, but the feature is collecting dust in a feature branch, it is not delivered. The Lead time is for the whole process. Not for individual steps.

One of the reasons why we practice Devops, so development en deploy are closely integrated. That way we can improve Lead Time. It is why QA is part of the team, testing is not something that starts after development. We are optimising for the whole. If the new dish from the new recipe is not delivered at my table, I'm still hungry.
