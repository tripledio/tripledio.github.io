### First time right

The term "First time right" is best known in quality management. Because needing to do a job more than once is obviously waste, we need to strive for excellence in our initial efforts, not relying on changing, improving what we delivered afterward.

Given that working iteratively should be a well known practice in the software field, it amazes me how big the aversion of doing something more than once can be with software engineers. There is a strong desire to "get it right", making sure we got everything covered, trying to foresee all possible use-cases and possible changes in the future. Because we have to do it right.

The mindset of trying to do things just once also occurs with knowledge transfers. With onboarding new people on the project, explaining new features, the architecture etc... All too often the desire is there to do any the knowledge transfer just once, a resistance to explaining things multiple times.  

### The pain of First time right

Variability in Product development is not a bad thing if it comes with a high enough economic pay-off. We should prefer "responding to change over following a plan" if this is more valuable. But this is a hard thing todo


Not doing it more than once
- Sunken cost
- not learning
- waterfall
- DRY
- I will say this only once

  Given that working iteratively should be a well known practice in the software field, it amazes me how big the aversion of doing something more than once can be with software engineers. The desire to "get it right" can lead to big upfront design where one is hesitant to start tackling a problem until everything is clear. Or engineers wil over design a solution, trying to foresee all possible use-cases and possible changes in the future.

How many "prototypes" make it into production and are then adopted as the real version? Surely if it works, we aren't just going to throw it away to do it again? To be fair, this is a scenario that I mostly have seen imposed by management.

>It's only a prototype until it works
  
Striving for perfection, getting it right from the start, often holds us back from working iteratively. Even though we really need more of that adaptable, iterative mindset.

Variability in Product development is not a bad thing if it comes with a high enough economic pay-off. We should prefer "responding to change over following a plan" if this is more valuable. But this is a hard thing todo
