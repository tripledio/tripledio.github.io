# The lone ranger

*This post belongs to small series of posts. The main post is [Wild west heroes](/10/05/2018/heroes/). In this post I'll go into a bit more detail what I identify as the Lone ranger "hero" pattern.*

The lone ranger is, as the name suggest, a person who is more of loner. Lone rangers get the job done by themselves, work alone. Always there to save the day that needs constant saving. Some take pride in their lone ranger actions, bot others would very much like to put an end to the necessity of it and live a quiet happy life. But circumstances won't let them.

   
The lone rangers are the software engineers who are always on call, always there when the shits hit the fan. They are the lone ranger that always saves the day. But no one really knows what is going on. This is a type of 'hero' that I have come across on several occasions as well. Almost always the case the hero was barely keeping everything a float, trying to catch a break, keeping up the illusion that everything is under control, hoping to eventually get their life back. Often no one really knows how bad the situation is because there is only one who knows what is really going on.

> Due to a lack of knowledge, discipline, or ability to say no, things have gotten out of control. 

The lone ranger often runs the risk for a burnout. Which is especially dangerous since they can't be missed. They are often revered by the customer, since they are the ones saving the day. But that is a sentiment that often passes over time as the customer gets tired of the never ending problems.

> If you need constant saving by heroes, you might consider hiring some professionals

Of course sometimes things can still go wrong in production. An urgent intervention can be needed. But this should really be an exceptional case. And when it does happen, it should be dealt with swiftly. With a thorough post morten so that we learn how to avoid this in the future, making sure _it does not happen again_. Because we don't want to let the exceptional become the normal.

The **lone rangers** may look like they have everything under control. But things are brewing beneath the surface. And it will inevitably explode. If this is not on our radar we very well could make the evening news on some idle thursday. Beware! Make sure we know what is going one. Exceptional interventions should be very exceptional. Chaos should not be the norm!
