# The young buck

This post belongs to small series of posts. The main post is [Wild west heroes](/20/05/2018/Heroes/). In this post I'll go into a bit more detail what I identify as the Young Buck "hero" pattern.

With *the young buck* if refer to the young gunslingers full of high ideals, with a simplistic sense of justice, who do all the fighting and take all the risks. Unfortunately they often get played for a fool and someone else reaps the benefit from their efforts. The result of their struggles might not be what they wanted, the townspeople might not be so pleased with the result. As a result they often get scorned and chased away by the very people they were fighting for. 

The mainly see themselves as a hero, if they are lucky they are also appreciated by the people they are helping. But they don't realise that they are often just used for canon fodder and for doing the dirty work. A third party might misuse their sense of heroics for their own gain. 

In the software world I have seen these 'young buck' hero typically in a consulting context. The young developers, with little experience, starting with a consultancy firm. They are the ones the most easy to convince that they need to put in the time, work hard, pull late nighters, work in the weekends, to make that big deadline. Often of some fixed-prize waterfall project that was bound to fail from the start. Yes, people still do big waterfall projects. Remember Obama care? [^obama-cio]

The developers that are doing this hard work, rushing from deadline to deadline, often do this from a misplaced sense of pride. Perhaps even a sense of professionalism. Look at us working hard, getting things done. Our company and customer will be so proud... 

It is precisely that sense of taking pride in doing 'heroic' deeds that categorizes them for me as the young buck. I've certainly seen older consultants do yet another project with crazy arbitrary deadlines. But usually they have long lost the pride part and are doing it because it pays the bills or advances their career with the boss. They do it consciously.
    
The young buck hero was for me what Sandro Mancuso discussed in a very recognizable way in chapter 5 of his book [The Software Craftsman](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Craftsman-Professionalism-Pragmatism-Robert/dp/0134052501/) [^sandroBook]. Being a hero may make you feel good about yourself, that you are saving the day, making crazy deadlines, doing a lot of overtime... 

Often the only one who benefits form these heroics is the young bucks boss. Who get's paid by the customer for the work and overtime. Of course often a bone will be thrown towards the ones doing the actual work. But it isn't the boss that is sitting there in the weekends, pulling an all nighter...

Even if the deadline is met the customer is often left with very poorly written software which a high maintenance cost. Did I mention Obama care[^obama-cbs]? I could of course mention a lot of belgian projects as well. The young bucks may feel like heroes while they are rushing for the deadline, doing quick fixes, patch job after path job in production but in the long run it is the software that suffers and the customer that will overpay for a low quality product. Because it is more important _how_ a job was done, than that the job was done. Because as we all know, software always changes, and is never 'done'. And that is a good thing. There should be life _possible_ after a deadline.[^constructionTale] 

To those young bucks out there let me make it clear that working hard no matter what does not make you a professional. Not even if you 'make' the deadline by working 16hours a day. 

> Heroics shouldn't come into play, heroes should not be necessary, the day should not _need_ saving. 

While it may be a heroic thing to do, it would have been better if it never was necessary. That the job was just predictable steadiness, without any heroic battles... 
     
Of course sometimes things can still go wrong in production. An urgent intervention can be needed. But this should really be an exceptional case. And when it does happen, it should be dealt with swiftly. With a thorough post morten so that we learn how to avoid this in the future, making sure _it does not happen again_. Because we don't want to let the exceptional become the normal.
    

As someone at the start of their career, finally playing with the big boys, working on real big and important projects, it may seem perfectly reasonable to work hard from deadline to deadline. No more time for academic discussions. The customer wants it now!

For a **young buck** this may feel like they are doing the right thing. Working hard, making deadlines, saving the day. But seen from some distance they are creating a mess, rushing from deadline to deadline. Delivering low quality and potentially causing a lot of damage. Luckily just like with young cowboys, if they surive the battles after a while they become experienced gunslingers who won't fight a needless fight or get played for a fool.
