# The young buck

*This post belongs to small series of posts. The main post is [Wild west heroes](/31/05/2018/Heroes/).* 

In this post I'll elaborate on what I identify as the Young Buck "hero" pattern. With the *young buck* I want to refer to the image to the young gunslingers just leaving home and stepping out into the bug world. often they are full of high ideals and have a simplistic sense of justice. Unfortunately they often get played for a fool and end up doing all the fighting and take all the risks while someone else reaps the benefit from their efforts. The end result of their struggles might not be what they hoped for. The townspeople might not be so pleased with the carnage lying in their wake. They often end up get scorned and chased away by the very people they were fighting for. 

The young bucks mainly see themselves as a hero, or they aspire to be one. Their eagerness to make it in the wild west often makes them vulnerable to being used as canon fodder and doing someone else dirty work. A third party might misuse their sense of heroics for their own gain, exploiting that they don't know any better yet. 

### Young consultants

In the software world I have seen these 'young buck' hero typically in a consulting context. The young developers, with little experience, starting with a consultancy firm. They are the ones the most easy to convince that they need to put in the time, work hard, pull late nighters, work in the weekends, in order to make that big deadline. This often happens on some fixed-prize waterfall project that was bound to fail from the start.  ( Yes, people still do big waterfall projects. Remember Obama care? [^obama-cio] )

The developers that are doing this hard work, rushing from deadline to deadline, often do this from a misplaced sense of pride. Perhaps even a sense of professionalism. **Look at us working hard, getting things done.** Our company and customer will be so proud... 

Now of course you don't have to be young to be a young buck. But it helps ;)

### Pride

It is precisely that sense of taking pride in doing 'heroic' deeds that categorizes them for me as the young buck. Of course I've  seen many older consultants participate on yet another project with crazy arbitrary, deadlines. But usually they have long lost the pride aspect or any illusion that they are being professional. They are doing it because it pays the bills or advances their career with the boss. They do it consciously, knowing full well that what they are doing and where it leads to. 
    
The young buck hero was for me what Sandro Mancuso discussed in a very recognizable way in chapter 5 of his book [The Software Craftsman](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Craftsman-Professionalism-Pragmatism-Robert/dp/0134052501/) [^sandroBook]. Being a hero may make you feel good about yourself, give you the sense that you are saving the day, that you are one of the hard workers, one of the professionals...

### The software

Even if the deadline is met the customer is often left with very poorly written software which a high maintenance cost. Did I mention Obama care[^obama-cbs]? I could of course mention a lot of belgian projects as well. The young bucks may feel like heroes while they are rushing for the deadline, doing quick fixes, patch job after path job in production but in the long run it is the software that suffers and the customer that will overpay for a low quality product. Because it is more important _how_ a job was done, than that the job was done. Because as we all know, software always changes, and is never 'done'. And that is a good thing. There should be life _possible_ for the software after a deadline.[^constructionTale] 

## Who benefits?

Often the only one who benefits form these heroics is the young bucks boss. The boss is the one that get's paid by the customer for the work and overtime. Of course often a bone will be thrown towards the ones doing the actual work. But it isn't the boss that is sitting there in the weekends, pulling an all nighter, sacrificing their social lives.

Once sufficient deadlines have passed and the software goes onto development mode this is even more beneficial for the boss. The customer is still in need of software engineers to maintain and possibly extend the software. Which takes more time then it should due to the numerous shortcuts that where taken. The young bucks are left maintaining the software and hopefully cleaning up a bit of the l;arge technical debt they created.

There is a benefit to all of this for the young bucks. It is called **experience**. If they are paying attention they learn how *not* to run a software project. And why best practices of software design are best practices. It will allow them to learn and to avoid being exploited in the future.

### Professionalism

To those young bucks out there, who are in their first rodeo, let me make it clear that working hard no matter what does not make you a professional. Not even if you 'make' the deadline by working 16 hours a day. 

> Heroics shouldn't come into play, heroes should not be necessary, the day should not _need_ saving. 

Don't kid yourself. Don't allow others to give you sense of guilt because you aren't there with them on that crazy deadline.  While it may be a heroic thing to do, it is often also a stupid thing to do. As 'heroics' things often are. It would have been much better if the heroics never were necessary. That the job was just predictable steadiness, without any heroic battles... 
   
### The time for heroics
     
Of course sometimes things can still go wrong in production. An urgent intervention can be needed.  But this should really be an exceptional case. And when it does happen, it should be dealt with swiftly. With a thorough post morten so that we learn how to avoid this in the future, making sure _it does not happen again_. Because we don't want to let the exceptional become the normal.

Deadlines are prevalent in our industry. But while a real deadline can exist (one of the business requirements. GDPR for example. Not an arbitrary deadline a manager cooked up to impress someone) the scope should be changeable. If something can not be done, it can't be done. Sleep is a required attribute for quality software. The time that a given deadline scared or impressed me is long gone. It should still be business as usual. If you can not make a deadline with proper, disciplined work, then you don't want to 'make it' with chaotic, sleep deprived work. 

As someone at the start of their career, finally playing with the big boys, working on real big and important projects, it may seem perfectly reasonable to work hard from deadline to deadline. No more time for academic discussions. The customer wants it now! This is the real world!

### Conclusion

For a **young buck** it may seem that working hard, making deadlines, saving the day is doing the right thing. But seen from a distance it is just another software mess under construction. Delivering low quality software and potentially causing a lot of damage to the firm. Luckily just like with young cowboys, if they survive the battles after a while they become experienced gunslingers who won't fight a needless fight or get played for a fool.
