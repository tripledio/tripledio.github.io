# Maximizing resource efficiency

*This post belongs to small series of posts on efficiency. The main post is [The cost of efficiency](/27/03/2024/cost-of-efficiency/).*

TODO clean this up 

Since resources are scares and expensive we want to utilize them as much as possible. A machine on the factory floor that is not working is waste. So this must mean that people not being occupied 100% of the time is also waste. Conversations at the coffee machine, working with multiple people on the same problem... all necessary evil. If people were machines, we could get really efficient. Unfortunately they are not, but it is still seen as a goal to aim for, to be busy as much as possible. To aim for that max % of resource utilization.

The case for maximum resource utilization is often made when practices ar Pair programming or Team (mob) programming are discussed. If the idea lives that Software Engineers need to be typing in order to be productive, then those collaborative practices are logically seen as a waste of resources. Meetings are then seen as waste of time by default. (Although this is probably a worldwide phenomenon :-) ) and this could also extend to design sessions. 

In my experience this drive for max resource utilization is held by management as well as by software engineers themselves. Even the view that they must be writing code in order to be productive is held by many Software Engineers. After all that is what they are paid to do right? Writing code.

We all want to be productive, to feel like we are adding value. Getting "in the zone" with our headsets on seems like the best way to achieve this. And of course the most enjoyable as well.

## The pain of Maximum resource utilization

If the goal is maximum resource utilization, we aim to be always busy, always going forward, no one is idle. We don't spend time on knowledge sharing, redundancy since this doesn't deliver output in itself. We focus on producing concrete output, preferably with everyone having their own clear task where they can work on undisturbed.

While this may be more efficient when everything is clear, well-thought-out and when nothing ever changes, I am however still waiting for the first software project where this is the case. In software development, change is key. If everyone is busy, and something unexpected happens we have a problem. When a feature changes, an estimate was wrong, someone changed their minds, a colleague falls ill, ... There is no space available to cope with this, because everyone is busy. Our well taught out plan goes down the drain and the poor PM needs to frantically try to come up with a credible plan again and fix all those Gantt charts. Added on top of this, invisible in all those pretty graphs, is that there is most likely a knowledge problem. We can not simply let Brent's task be done by Max. There are so many specialized tasks, for which certain expertise is needed. As well as built up knowledge of the current system, business. The division of labor isn't always as clear as by role title. On paper, you could replace one python developer with 5 years experience by another python developer with 5 years experience. But in reality, you've lost a big part of knowledge which will take time to rebuild. Since knowledge wasn't shared on a continuous basis with others, we simply aren't resilient. And no, writing lots of confluence pages before you leave doesn't count. Confluence is where documentation information goes to die. 

The drive for max resource utilization, for being efficient, is held by management as well as by software engineers themselves. Management thinks that if Software Engineers aren't typing, they are not being productive. After all their job is to translate business requirements into code. So the engineer who writes the least code must be the [worst engineer](https://dannorth.net/the-worst-programmer/)?  

A corresponding view often held by Software Engineers themselves is

> If I'm not writing code, I'm not being productive

As a result practices as Pair programming or Team (mob) programming are often seen as a big waste of resources. We have two people working on the same thing and only one of them is typing? We have a whole team working on one thing and only one person is typing??

This argument would make sense if what software engineers do is indeed simply translating business requirement into code. And if this is indeed your job, you should fear all the LLM AI that can generate code. But as any experienced software engineer knows, writing code is the easy part. 

> Typing is not the bottleneck

Correlated with the above, the aim for maximum resource utilization can also hinder to communication and collaboration. Meetings are seen as waste of time because we could be writing code instead of discussing things. Personally I have found that is really hard to let people let go of their keyboard and discuss the problem, to actually design. We seem to prefer to build the wrong thing fast, then making sure we're actually solving the right problem. Due to the drive to be busy people prefer generating output (code) over outcome (solving), 

> We prefer building the wrong thing fast, then the solving the right thing well

Given the nature of software engineering, the drive to produce, to be busy is especially harmful. Because it is not about producing code, but about solving problems. And it is hard to do this "efficient." Just like it is hard to be creative on command.
