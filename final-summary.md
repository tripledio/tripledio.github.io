# UI Animation Enhancements Summary

I've added subtle highlights and animations to tables and other UI components using the existing color scheme. Here's what I've implemented:

## Table Enhancements
- **Row Hover Effects**: Tables now have subtle background color changes and slight movement when hovering over rows
- **Header Styling**: Table headers use the primary color (#21314c) with a subtle shimmer animation
- **Cell Highlights**: Table cells change color and display an animated underline when hovered
- **Alternating Row Colors**: Even rows have a light background for better readability

## Other UI Component Animations
- **Button Hover Effects**: Added a shimmer animation to buttons for more interactivity
- **Card Hover Effects**: Cards now slightly lift up and have enhanced shadows on hover
- **Service Icon Animation**: Icons scale and rotate slightly on hover for a more engaging experience

All animations use the existing color scheme to maintain brand consistency while adding a more dynamic feel to the interface. The animations are subtle and professional, appropriate for a business IT supplier that thinks out of the box.

The CSS for these enhancements is provided in the `_table-animations.scss` file, and detailed implementation instructions are available in the documentation files. These enhancements complement the modernized layout we previously implemented, creating a more interactive and engaging user experience.
