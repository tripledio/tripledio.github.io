Enabling you to continuously reap the benefits from a well designed solution both now and in the future. Therefore open and honest communication is necessary.

	<h3 class="h5 font-family-bold text-black mb-2">Ownership of the development process</h3>
	<p>When you hire Triple D, you hire people who have spent a lot of their time in getting proficient in their job. A job that is so much more than writing code. So let us own the whole development process. That way we can really deliver.</p>

<div class="col-12 col-md-8 offset-md-2 mb-2 mb-md-4">
	<h3 class="h5 font-family-bold text-black mb-2">Direct communication with all stakeholders</h3>
	<p>We donâ€™t believe in long communication chains and huge documents. We talk to the business, we build software for them, they should be the ones we are talking to.</p>

<div class="col-12 col-md-8 offset-md-2 mb-2 mb-md-4">
	<h3 class="h5 font-family-bold text-black mb-2">Immediate short feedback loops</h3>
	<p>Continuous integration and continuous delivery enables the team to work at full speed. A good delivery pipeline also allows the customer to see and use the features within minutes after finishing a development iteration. This enables the team to quickly gather feedback on the delivered product, pivot if necessary and constantly go for maximum business value.</p>
