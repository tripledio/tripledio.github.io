            <h3 class="h5 font-family-bold text-black mb-2  text-center">Honest partnership</h3>
            <p>We value open communication more than negotiated contracts. The end goal of a successful partnership is that both partners are pleased with the result. We want to build the software you need and enable you to continuously reap the benefits from a well-designed solution. Since software is a learning process, developing it iteratively is paramount in order to get the best result from our learnings. An open and honest communication, where there is trust in having a mutual goal is paramount for this.</p>

            <h3 class="h5 font-family-bold text-black mb-2">Direct communication</h3>
            <p>We donâ€™t believe in long communication chains and huge documents. We build software for the business, they should be the ones we are talking to. There is no need for a middle man, we don't want to be become code monkeys. We can bring so much more to the table.</p>

            <h3 class="h5 font-family-bold text-black mb-2">Ownership of the development process</h3>
            <p>When you hire Triple D, you hire people who have spent a lot of their time in getting proficient in their job. A job that is so much more than writing code. So let us own the development process. That way we can really deliver. Waterfall is not the way.</p>

            <h3 class="h5 font-family-bold text-black mb-2">Ownership of the deployment process</h3>
            <p>Continuous integration and continuous delivery enables the team to work at full speed. A good delivery pipeline also allows the customer to see and use the features within minutes after finishing a development iteration. This enables the team to quickly gather feedback on the delivered product, pivot if necessary and constantly go for maximum business value. We want to maximize learning and reduce the cost of wrong decisions. The faster we know, the faster we can switch gears. </p>
