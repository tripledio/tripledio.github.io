# Team Member Name Hover Fix

## Issue
When hovering over team members in the circular layout, their names were getting cut off, making them difficult to read.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by three main factors:
1. The team member container had `overflow: hidden` which clipped any content outside the circular boundary
2. The name label was positioned within the circle and had a fixed width of 100% of the circle
3. The transform on hover was only moving the name vertically, not accounting for longer names

## Solution
I implemented the following changes to ensure team member names are fully visible on hover:

### 1. Modified the Team Member Container
```css
.team-member-item {
  overflow: visible; /* Changed from hidden to visible */
}
```
This allows content (specifically the name) to extend beyond the circular boundary of the team member.

### 2. Ensured Photos Stay Circular
```css
.team-member-photo {
  border-radius: 50%; /* Ensure photo stays circular */
  overflow: hidden; /* Keep photo within bounds */
}
```
Since we removed `overflow: hidden` from the container, we needed to ensure the photos still maintain their circular shape.

### 3. Completely Redesigned the Name Label
```css
.team-member-name {
  left: 50%;
  transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(100%);
  min-width: 100%;
  width: auto;
  white-space: nowrap;
  padding: 5px 10px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
  z-index: 10;
}

.team-member-item:hover .team-member-name {
  transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(110%);
}
```

Key improvements:
- Centered the name horizontally using `left: 50%` and `transform: translateX(-50%)`
- Used `min-width: 100%` and `width: auto` to allow the name to expand as needed
- Added `white-space: nowrap` to prevent text wrapping
- Added padding on the sides for better readability
- Added rounded corners and a subtle shadow for a more polished look
- Positioned the name below the circle on hover with a small gap (110% instead of 100%)
- Added `z-index: 10` to ensure the name appears above other elements

## Result
Team member names now appear fully visible below the circle when hovering, regardless of their length. The names are centered, have a polished appearance with rounded corners and a subtle shadow, and are completely readable.
