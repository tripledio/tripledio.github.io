# Twitter Link Removal Summary

## Changes Made
I've removed the Twitter link from the footer of the website. This involved:

1. Identifying the Twitter link in the footer section of the `_layouts/default.html` file
2. Removing the following code block:
   ```html
   {% if site.twitter.username %}
   <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter.username }}" class="socialicon tw">
       <img src="/fonts/x-twitter.svg" alt="twitter-x icon" class="socialicon-svg">
   {% endif %}
   ```

## Result
The footer now only contains:
- RSS feed link
- LinkedIn link (if configured)
- Email link (if configured)

The Twitter link has been completely removed from the site footer, as requested.

## Technical Details
The change was implemented by modifying the `_layouts/default.html` file, which contains the main layout template for the entire site, including the footer section.

The Twitter link was conditionally included based on the presence of the `site.twitter.username` configuration variable, so removing this code block ensures the Twitter link will no longer appear regardless of the configuration.
