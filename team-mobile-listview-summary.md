# Team Page Mobile Listview Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to implement a mobile-friendly listview for the team page while preserving the desktop circular layout.

## Problem
The team page looked great on desktop with its circular layout, but it didn't work properly on mobile devices. The circular layout was not responsive enough for smaller screens, making it difficult to navigate and view team member information.

## Solution
The solution was to implement a traditional listview for mobile devices while preserving the circular layout for desktop. This was achieved through responsive CSS and JavaScript that adapts the layout based on the screen size.

## Changes Made

### CSS Changes (_sass/_team-circle.scss)
1. **Mobile Media Query**: Updated the media query for screens with max-width of 767px (matching $breakpoint-md)
2. **Hide Circular Elements**: Hidden the sunburst effect and default center content on mobile
3. **Vertical List Layout**: Converted the circular layout to a vertical list using flexbox
4. **Card-like Team Members**: Styled each team member as a card with:
   - Photo on the left
   - Name and description on the right
   - Proper spacing and styling
5. **Bio Display**: Added styling for displaying team member bios within their cards on mobile
6. **Hover and Active States**: Adjusted hover and active states for better mobile interaction

### HTML Changes (team.html)
1. **Content Wrapper**: Added a content wrapper div for each team member
2. **Description Element**: Added a description element that's visible in the mobile view

### JavaScript Changes (team.html)
1. **Responsive Detection**: Added detection for mobile devices based on window width
2. **Conditional Positioning**: Only applied circular positioning for desktop devices
3. **Different Click Behaviors**:
   - Desktop: Show bio in center area
   - Mobile: Toggle bio visibility within the team member card
4. **DOM Manipulation**: Move bio elements inside team member items on mobile
5. **Window Resize Handling**: Added handler to adapt when switching between mobile and desktop views

## Results
The team page now has:
1. **Desktop View**: A visually appealing circular layout with team members positioned around a central area
2. **Mobile View**: A traditional, easy-to-navigate listview where:
   - Team members are displayed in a vertical list
   - Each team member has their photo, name, and a brief description visible
   - Clicking a team member expands to show their full bio
   - The layout is optimized for smaller screens

This implementation provides a better user experience on mobile devices while maintaining the original desktop design.
