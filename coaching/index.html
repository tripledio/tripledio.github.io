                <p>Apart from designing and developing software ourselves we also love to teach it to passionate people. That is why, upon request, we are also
                    available for <b>personalised individual coaching</b>. These are typically remote sessions that can easily be set up, so distance is not a
                    factor. Here we specifically
                    have software engineers in mind who want to improve their skills in their own time.</p>

                <p>In this formula you do the work in your own time, at your own pace. But with a personal coach available who is there to challenge and guide
                    you. Enabling you to improve your skills more efficiently in your own time. The coaching sessions are customised specifically to your needs.
                    This way you can learn what
                    you
                    want to, at a pace and timing that suits you best.<br><br>
